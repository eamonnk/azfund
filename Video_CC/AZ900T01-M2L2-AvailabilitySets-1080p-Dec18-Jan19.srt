00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
>> Availability sets are a way

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,750
for you to ensure
your application remains

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,000
online if a high-impact
maintenance event

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,730
is required or
a hardware failure occurs.

5
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:14,110
Availability sets are made up of
update domains and fault domains.

6
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,750
When a maintenance event occurs,

7
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:20,430
such as a performance update or

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:22,410
a critical security patch
applied to a host,

9
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,500
the update is sequenced
through update domains.

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,320
Sequencing updates using
update domains ensures that

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,400
the entire datacenter is not

12
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,505
unavailable during
platform updates and patching.

13
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:35,010
Update domains are
a logical section of

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,825
the datacenter and they are
implemented with software and logic.

15
00:00:38,825 --> 00:00:41,780
Fault domains provide for
the physical separation of

16
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,240
your workload across different
hardware in the datacenter.

17
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,655
This includes power, cooling,

18
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:48,320
network hardware that supports

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,785
the physical servers
located in the server rack.

20
00:00:50,785 --> 00:00:52,530
In the event that
the hardware supporting

21
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,985
the server rack becomes unavailable,

22
00:00:53,985 --> 00:00:57,400
only that rack of servers will
be affected by the outage.
