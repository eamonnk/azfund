00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,590
>> Serverless computing is

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:04,395
a Cloud hosted execution environment
that runs your code,

3
00:00:04,395 --> 00:00:06,945
but obstructs the underlying
hosting environment.

4
00:00:06,945 --> 00:00:09,765
You create an instance of the
service and you add your code.

5
00:00:09,765 --> 00:00:11,340
No infrastructure configuration or

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:13,320
maintenance is required
or even allowed.

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,185
You configure your serverless app
to respond to events.

8
00:00:16,185 --> 00:00:18,645
An event could be a REST endpoint,

9
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:20,180
a Periodic Timer, or

10
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:22,670
even a message received
from another Azure service.

11
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,835
The serverless app runs only
when it's triggered by an event.

12
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:28,700
Scaling and performance
are handled automatically

13
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:31,775
and you're billed only for
the exact resources you use.

14
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:34,385
You don't even need
to reserve resources.

15
00:00:34,385 --> 00:00:37,070
Some of the most common
serverless service types

16
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:39,325
in Azure are Azure Functions.

17
00:00:39,325 --> 00:00:41,990
Azure Functions are ideal when
you're only concerned with the code

18
00:00:41,990 --> 00:00:43,070
running your service and

19
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:45,290
not the underlying platform
or infrastructure.

20
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,210
Azure Functions are commonly used

21
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:48,740
when you need to perform
work in response to

22
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,330
an event and when that work can be

23
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:53,095
completed quickly
within seconds or less.

24
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:55,790
Azure Functions scale
automatically and charges

25
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:57,830
accrue only when
a function is triggered.

26
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:59,630
So, there are solid choice
when demand is

27
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:03,785
variable. Azure Logic Apps.

28
00:01:03,785 --> 00:01:06,110
Azure Logic Apps is a Cloud
service that helps you

29
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:08,740
automate and orchestrate
tasks, business processes,

30
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:11,450
and workflows, when you need
to integrate apps, data,

31
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:15,260
systems, and services across
enterprises and organizations.

32
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:19,630
Logic Apps simplifies how you design
and build scalable solutions,

33
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:20,770
whether in the Cloud,

34
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,050
on-premises, or both.
Azure Event Grid.

35
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:26,210
Azure Event Grid allows
you to easily build

36
00:01:26,210 --> 00:01:28,430
applications with
event-based architectures.

37
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:31,550
It's a fully managed intelligent
event routing service that

38
00:01:31,550 --> 00:01:35,480
uses a publish-subscribe model
for uniform event consumption.

39
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,640
Event Grid has built-in support for

40
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:39,440
events coming from Azure services,

41
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,200
such as storage blobs
and resource groups.
