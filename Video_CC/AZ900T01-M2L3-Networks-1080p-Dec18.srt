1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,740
>> Now, working on Azure

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:03,720
allows you to connect
cloud and on-premises

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,580
infrastructure and
services to provide

4
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,385
your customers and users with
the best possible experience.

5
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:10,590
Once your resources moved to Azure,

6
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:12,524
they require the same
networking functionality

7
00:00:12,524 --> 00:00:14,220
as an on-premises deployment.

8
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,530
Some of the most common
networking service types in

9
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:19,200
Azure, Azure Virtual Network.

10
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,730
Azure Virtual Network enables

11
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,680
many types of Azure resources such as

12
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,690
Azure VMs to securely
communicate with

13
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:27,450
each other the internet
and on-premises networks.

14
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,010
With Azure Virtual Network,

15
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,245
you can provide
isolation, segmentation,

16
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:33,720
communication when on-premises
and cloud resources,

17
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,945
routing and filtering
of networking traffic.

18
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:40,280
Azure Load Balancer.
Azure Load Balancer can provide

19
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,900
scale for applications and create

20
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,940
high availability for your services.

21
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,715
You can use load balancer with
incoming internet traffic,

22
00:00:46,715 --> 00:00:49,040
internal traffic
across Azure services,

23
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,305
port forwarding for
specific traffic or

24
00:00:51,305 --> 00:00:54,605
outbound connectivity for
VMs in your virtual network.

25
00:00:54,605 --> 00:00:57,650
VPN gateway. A VPN gateway can

26
00:00:57,650 --> 00:00:58,800
also be referred to as a Virtual

27
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,260
Network Gateway that is used to send

28
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,570
encrypted traffic between
an Azure Virtual Network

29
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,555
and an on-premises location
over the public internet.

30
00:01:05,555 --> 00:01:08,000
Provides a more secure
connection from

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,520
on-premises to Azure
over the Internet.

32
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,380
Azure Application Gateway.

33
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,900
Azure Application Gateway is
a web traffic load balancer

34
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:18,310
that enables you to manage
traffic to your web applications,

35
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:20,180
and it's a connection
through its users

36
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:22,020
connect to your application.

37
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,385
Content Delivery Network.

38
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:27,380
A Content Delivery Network
is a distributed network of

39
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:31,240
servers that can efficiently
deliver web content to users.

40
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,500
It is a way to get
content to users in

41
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,470
their local region
to minimize latency.
