00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,090
>> Using Azure, requires
an Azure subscription,

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:06,000
which provides you with authenticated
and authorized access to

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,580
Azure products and services and

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,560
allows you to provision
Azure resources.

5
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,790
An Azure subscription
is a logical unit of

6
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,970
Azure services that links you
to an Azure account which is

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,745
on identity and Azure
Active Directory Azure ID

8
00:00:17,745 --> 00:00:21,160
or in a directory that
an Azure ID trust.

9
00:00:21,830 --> 00:00:25,185
Azure offers free and paid
subscription options,

10
00:00:25,185 --> 00:00:27,510
to suit different needs
and requirements.

11
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:30,870
An account can have one or
more subscriptions with

12
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:31,920
different billing models and

13
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:35,260
access management policies
applied to each subscription.

14
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,330
You can use Azure subscriptions
to define boundaries

15
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,940
around Azure products,
services, and resources.

16
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:45,320
There are two types of subscription
boundaries that you can use.

17
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,960
A Billing boundary:
This subscription type

18
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:50,540
determines how Azure account
is billed for using Azure.

19
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:52,220
You can create multiple subscriptions

20
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,930
for different types of
billing requirements.

21
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:58,485
Access control boundary.

22
00:00:58,485 --> 00:01:00,440
Azure would apply
access management policies

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:01,820
at the subscription level and you

24
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,230
can create separate subscriptions to

25
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:06,180
reflect different
organizational structures.

26
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,615
You can select from a range of

27
00:01:08,615 --> 00:01:10,480
Azure subscription options including

28
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,780
A free account: This subscription is

29
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,480
for 30 days and
includes a $200 credit.

30
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,800
Pay As You Go: This subscription
allows you to pay for what you

31
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:22,800
use by attaching your credit card
or a debit card to your account.

32
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,150
Member offers:
Your existing membership

33
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:27,410
to certain Microsoft products and

34
00:01:27,410 --> 00:01:29,390
services affords you credits for

35
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:33,330
your Azure account on
reduced rates on Azure services.

36
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:38,960
Azure Management groups are
containers for managing access,

37
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,205
policies, and compliance across
multiple Azure subscriptions.

38
00:01:43,205 --> 00:01:45,770
Management Groups allow you to order

39
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,875
your Azure resources hierarchically

40
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,820
into collections which provides

41
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:53,400
a further level of classification
beyond subscriptions.

42
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,130
You can manage your Azure
subscriptions more effectively by

43
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,090
using Azure policy and Azure
role-based access controls.

44
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:04,685
These provide distinct
governance conditions

45
00:02:04,685 --> 00:02:07,040
that you can apply to
each management group.

46
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,870
The resources and subscriptions

47
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,190
you assigned to a management group,

48
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,795
automatically inherit the conditions

49
00:02:11,795 --> 00:02:13,870
that you apply to
that management group.
