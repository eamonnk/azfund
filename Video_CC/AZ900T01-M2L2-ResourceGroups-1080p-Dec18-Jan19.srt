00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,770
>> A resource group is a unit

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:04,200
of management for your
resources in Azure.

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,120
You can think of
your resource group as

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,310
a container that allows
you to aggregate and

5
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,020
manage all the resources required for

6
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,080
your application into
a single manageable units.

7
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,270
This allows you to
manage the application

8
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,115
collectively over its life cycle,

9
00:00:17,115 --> 00:00:19,425
rather than manage
components individually.

10
00:00:19,425 --> 00:00:21,570
You can manage and
apply to following at

11
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,330
the resource group level:
metering and billing,

12
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,000
policies, monitoring and alerts,

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,370
quotas, and access control.

14
00:00:29,370 --> 00:00:30,865
When you delete a resource group,

15
00:00:30,865 --> 00:00:33,600
you delete all the
resources within it.

16
00:00:34,060 --> 00:00:37,820
When creating and placing
resources within resource groups,

17
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:40,370
there are a few considerations
to take into account.

18
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:45,590
Each Azure resource must exist in
one and only one resource group.

19
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:47,870
A resource group can contain resorts

20
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:50,340
that reside in different regions.

21
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,630
You can add or remove a resource
to a resource group at anytime.

22
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:59,900
You can move a resource from
one resource group to another.

23
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,150
Resources for an application do not

24
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:03,955
need to exist in
the same resource group,

25
00:01:03,955 --> 00:01:06,020
however, it is recommended
that you keep them

26
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,730
in the same resource group
for ease of management.
