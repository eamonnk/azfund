00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,755
>> Now working on Azure

2
00:00:01,755 --> 00:00:03,750
allows you to connect
Cloud and on-premises

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,610
infrastructure and
services to provide

4
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:08,415
your customers and users with
the best possible experience.

5
00:00:08,415 --> 00:00:10,485
Once your resources move to Azure,

6
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:12,524
they require the same
networking functionality

7
00:00:12,524 --> 00:00:14,205
as an on-premises deployment.

8
00:00:14,205 --> 00:00:17,505
Some of the most common networking
service types in Azure are:

9
00:00:17,505 --> 00:00:20,370
Azure Virtual Network:
Azure Virtual Network

10
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,275
enables many types
of Azure resources,

11
00:00:22,275 --> 00:00:23,520
such as Azure VMs,

12
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,215
to securely communicate
with each other,

13
00:00:25,215 --> 00:00:27,705
the internet and
on-premises networks.

14
00:00:27,705 --> 00:00:29,130
With Azure Virtual Network, you

15
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,245
can provide isolation, segmentation,

16
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:33,735
communication when on-premises
and cloud resources,

17
00:00:33,735 --> 00:00:36,990
routing, and filtering
of networking traffic.

18
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,700
Azure Load Balancer: Azure Load
Balancer can provide scale

19
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,940
for applications and create
high availability for your services.

20
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:46,715
You can use load balance with
incoming internet traffic,

21
00:00:46,715 --> 00:00:48,890
internal traffic
across Azure services,

22
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:51,170
port forwarding for specific traffic,

23
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:54,625
or outbound connectivity for
VMs in your virtual network.

24
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:57,520
VPN gateway: A VPN Gateway

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,600
can also be referred to as
a Virtual Network Gateway.

26
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,580
But a VPN Gateway is
a specific type of

27
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:03,530
virtual network gateway
that is used to send

28
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,840
encrypted traffic between
an Azure Virtual Network

29
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,620
on an on-premises location
over the public internet.

30
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,970
It provides a more secure connection

31
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:13,775
from on-premises to
Azure over the internet.

32
00:01:13,775 --> 00:01:16,940
Azure Application Gateway:
Azure Application Gateway is

33
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,890
a web traffic load balancer
that enables you

34
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:21,625
to manage traffic to
your web applications.

35
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,430
It's the connection
through which users

36
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,290
connect to your application.

37
00:01:25,290 --> 00:01:29,420
Content Delivery Network:
A Content Delivery Network

38
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,420
is a distributed network of
servers that can efficiently,

39
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:34,505
deliver web content to users.

40
00:01:34,505 --> 00:01:36,770
It is a way to get
content to users in

41
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:39,730
their local region
to minimize latency.
