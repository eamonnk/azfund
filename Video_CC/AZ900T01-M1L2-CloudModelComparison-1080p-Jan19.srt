00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,430
>> So, what are some of
the advantages and disadvantages

2
00:00:02,430 --> 00:00:04,920
as you compare the different
types of cloud model?

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,960
Now for Public Cloud, some advantages
are: no capital expenditure.

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,050
You don't have to buy a new server
up and running north to scale.

5
00:00:13,050 --> 00:00:16,020
Agility, Applications can
be up and running and

6
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:19,410
accessible very quickly and deep
provisioned whenever needed.

7
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:22,290
Consumption-based model,
pay only for what you

8
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:26,595
use and it operates under
an operational expenditure model.

9
00:00:26,595 --> 00:00:29,460
Maintenance, there
is no responsibility

10
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,505
for maintenance or updates
for any of the hardware.

11
00:00:32,505 --> 00:00:36,030
Skills, there's no
deep technical skills

12
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,379
needed to be able to deploy,

13
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:39,765
use and gain the benefits
of Public Cloud.

14
00:00:39,765 --> 00:00:42,120
You can leverage the skills
and expertise of

15
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,760
the Cloud provider to ensure
your workloads are secure,

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,130
safe, and made highly
available in full part of.

17
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:53,190
Some disadvantages down for
Public Cloud are: Security,

18
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,270
it maybe specific security
requirements that cannot be met by

19
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,590
using Public Clouds depending on
your industry or your workload.

20
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:02,490
Compliance, that maybe
government policies,

21
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,145
industry standards or
legal requirements with

22
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:08,340
Public Clouds can not meet.

23
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,215
Ownership, you don't own
the hardware services,

24
00:01:11,215 --> 00:01:13,825
you can not manage them as you wish.

25
00:01:13,825 --> 00:01:17,455
Specific scenarios, if you
have a specific scenario,

26
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:20,270
unique business requirements
such as having to maintain

27
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:21,920
a legacy application that may be

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,495
difficult to meet that requirement
with Public Cloud.

29
00:01:24,495 --> 00:01:26,350
Let's move on and take a look at

30
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,850
some of the advantages
for Private Cloud.

31
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,860
Control, you have total control over

32
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:36,245
the resources and can configure
them anyway you wish.

33
00:01:36,245 --> 00:01:40,310
Security, you have
total control over security.

34
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,670
Compliance, if you have

35
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,505
very strict security compliance
or legal requirements,

36
00:01:45,505 --> 00:01:48,350
Private Cloud maybe the
only viable option.

37
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:50,260
Specific scenarios, if you have

38
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:51,670
a specific scenario and not supported

39
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:53,230
mainly by Public Cloud provider,

40
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:55,645
such as having to maintain
a legacy application,

41
00:01:55,645 --> 00:01:58,570
it may be a preferable scenario
to run your application

42
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:02,070
locally and have
total control over it.

43
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:03,600
Some disadvantages of Private Cloud

44
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,270
are: Upfront capital expenditure,

45
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,150
you need to purchase the hardware
for startup and maintenance.

46
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:15,165
Agility, not as agile
as Public Cloud,

47
00:02:15,165 --> 00:02:16,760
as you need to purchase and setup

48
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:19,915
all the underlying infrastructure
before you can leverage them.

49
00:02:19,915 --> 00:02:22,640
Maintenance, you have responsibility

50
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,255
for the maintenance and
updates of the hardware.

51
00:02:25,255 --> 00:02:28,910
Skills, it requires IT skills and

52
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,910
expertise that may be
hard or costly to access.

53
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:37,950
Find the, let's take a look at
the advantages for Hybrid Cloud.

54
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,255
Flexibility and agility,

55
00:02:42,255 --> 00:02:44,810
most flexible and agile
scenario allowing for

56
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,430
decisions through on
either locally in

57
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,765
Private Cloud or in Public Cloud
depending on your need.

58
00:02:49,765 --> 00:02:51,970
Costs, can take advantage of

59
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,250
economies of scale that
comes with Public Cloud.

60
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,550
Control, you can still
maintain total control over

61
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,350
application on data if

62
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,610
you need by using
your Private Cloud option.

63
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:03,490
Security, you can have

64
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,110
total control over security
in your Private Cloud.

65
00:03:06,110 --> 00:03:09,340
Compliance, maintain
the ability to support

66
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,430
very strict security, compliance
or legal requirements if needed.

67
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:17,230
Specific scenarios, you can
maintain the ability to support

68
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,700
specific scenarios not supported

69
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,395
easily by a public cloud provider,

70
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:22,445
such as running legacy applications.

71
00:03:22,445 --> 00:03:24,610
In this case, you could keep

72
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,560
an old system running
locally and connect it to

73
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,370
the public cloud for authorization
or storage or you could host

74
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:31,930
a website into Public Cloud
and link it to

75
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:35,750
a highly secure database hosted in
your Private Cloud for example.

76
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,195
There are so many disadvantages
for Hybrid Cloud.

77
00:03:40,195 --> 00:03:42,855
Upfront capital expenditure.

78
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:44,870
Upfront CapEX is still

79
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,515
required before you can
leverage your Private Cloud.

80
00:03:47,515 --> 00:03:50,540
Costs, wanting
two deployment models can be

81
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,725
more expensive than selecting
one deployment model.

82
00:03:53,725 --> 00:03:56,630
Skills, deep technical skills are

83
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:00,175
still required to be able
to set up a Private Cloud.

84
00:04:00,175 --> 00:04:03,320
Ease of management, you
need to make sure there are

85
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,550
clear guidelines to avoid any
confusion, complications, or misuse.
