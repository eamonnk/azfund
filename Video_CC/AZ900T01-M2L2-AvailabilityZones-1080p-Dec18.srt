1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,520
>> Availability Zones
are physically separate

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:04,230
locations within an Azure region.

3
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,000
Each Availability Zone is made up of

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,800
one or more data centers
equipped with

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,500
independent power,
cooling, and networking.

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,825
It is set up to be
an isolation boundary.

7
00:00:12,825 --> 00:00:14,835
If one Availability Zone goes down,

8
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:16,290
the owner continues working.

9
00:00:16,290 --> 00:00:17,970
The Availability Zones are typically

10
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:19,695
connected to each other to very fast,

11
00:00:19,695 --> 00:00:21,825
private fiber optic networks.

12
00:00:21,825 --> 00:00:24,330
Availability Zones allow
customers to run mission

13
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,534
critical applications
with high availability

14
00:00:26,534 --> 00:00:28,695
and low latency replication.

15
00:00:28,695 --> 00:00:32,235
An Availability Zones are offered
as a service within Azure.

16
00:00:32,235 --> 00:00:34,580
To ensure resiliency,
there's a minimum of

17
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:37,950
three separate zones in
all enabled regions.

18
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:41,000
To achieve comprehensive
business continuity on Azure,

19
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,280
build your application architecture
using the combination of

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,100
Availability Zones with
Azure Region Pairs.

21
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:50,570
Regions that support
Availability Zones are listed

22
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:56,270
here: The Azure services

23
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:59,040
