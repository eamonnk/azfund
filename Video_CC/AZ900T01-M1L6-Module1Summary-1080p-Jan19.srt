00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
>> In this module, you've
learned about Cloud computing,

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:05,310
what it is, a moderate
key characteristics.

3
00:00:05,310 --> 00:00:07,380
You've learned what are
some of the key terms

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:08,670
and concepts of Cloud computing,

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,165
such as high availability,
agility, elasticity,

6
00:00:12,165 --> 00:00:14,460
global reach, capital expenditure

7
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:17,295
versus operational expenditure in
the context of Cloud computing,

8
00:00:17,295 --> 00:00:20,820
economies of scale, and
the consumption-based cost model.

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,860
You then learned about
the public Cloud,

10
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:25,185
the Private cloud, and
the Hybrid cloud models.

11
00:00:25,185 --> 00:00:27,855
You learned what of the key
characteristics of each model,

12
00:00:27,855 --> 00:00:29,820
and also what are the considerations

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,710
you need to take account
of when using them,

14
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:34,785
as well as how they compare
and when they might be used.

15
00:00:34,785 --> 00:00:36,650
Finally, you learned about

16
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:38,719
the different types of
Cloud services available;

17
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,025
infrastructure as a service,

18
00:00:40,025 --> 00:00:41,225
platform as a service,

19
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:42,700
and software as a service.

20
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,500
You learned about the key
characteristics of each service,

21
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,700
what are the
considerations you need to

22
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,290
take account of when using them,

23
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:50,990
how they compare, and
when they might be used.

24
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:53,750
You also learned about the different
management responsibilities

25
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:55,860
onto each service type.
