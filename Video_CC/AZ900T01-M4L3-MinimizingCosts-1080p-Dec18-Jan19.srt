00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,000
>> The following best
practice guidelines can

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:04,905
help minimize your Azure costs.

3
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:07,200
Perform cost analysis.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,720
Plan your Azure solution wisely.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,190
Carefully consider the products,

6
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:12,720
services, and resources you need,

7
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,250
and read the relevant
documentation to

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,445
understand how each of your choices
are metered and billed.

9
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:20,490
Additionally, you should calculate
your projected costs by using

10
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,625
the Azure pricing and Total Cost
of Ownership calculators,

11
00:00:23,625 --> 00:00:25,290
only adding the products, services,

12
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,340
and resources you need.

13
00:00:27,410 --> 00:00:30,405
Monitor usage with Azure Advisor.

14
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:32,100
In an efficient architecture,

15
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,345
provision resources much to
demand for those resources.

16
00:00:35,345 --> 00:00:38,060
Azure Advisor is a feature that

17
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:41,185
identifies unused or
underutilized resources.

18
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:43,580
Enable Azure Advisor to implement

19
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,100
its recommendations by
removing unused resources and

20
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:47,860
configuring your resources
to match demand.

21
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,410
Your spending limits.

22
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,760
Free trial customers on

23
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:55,990
some credit-based Azure subscriptions
can use spending limits,

24
00:00:55,990 --> 00:00:58,550
which Azure provides to help
prevent you from exhausting

25
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,520
the credit on your account
within each billing period.

26
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,500
If you have a credit
base subscription

27
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,540
and you reach your
configured spending limit,

28
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:07,130
Azure suspends your subscription

29
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:09,205
until a new billing period begins.

30
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:11,540
A spending limit feature is not

31
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:14,080
available for customers who aren't
using credit by subscriptions,

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:15,955
such as pay-as-you-go subscribers.

33
00:01:15,955 --> 00:01:17,860
Use Azure reservations.

34
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,060
Azure reservations
offer discounted prices

35
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,160
on certain Azure products
and resources.

36
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,600
To get a discount, you reserved

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,625
products and resources
by paying in advance.

38
00:01:25,625 --> 00:01:27,530
You can pre-pay for one year or

39
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:29,765
three years of use
of virtual machines,

40
00:01:29,765 --> 00:01:31,535
SQL database compute capacity,

41
00:01:31,535 --> 00:01:33,260
Azure Cosmos database throughput,

42
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,075
and other Azure resources.

43
00:01:35,075 --> 00:01:37,310
Azure reservations
are only available to

44
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,200
Enterprise, or CSP customers,

45
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,045
and for Pay-as-You-Go subscriptions.

46
00:01:41,045 --> 00:01:43,415
Choose low cost locations in regions.

47
00:01:43,415 --> 00:01:45,180
The cost of Azure products, services,

48
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:47,600
and resources can vary
across locations,

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,940
regions, and if possible,

50
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:50,600
you should use them
in those locations

51
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:52,310
and regions where they cost less.

52
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,725
Research available
cost-saving offers.

53
00:01:54,725 --> 00:01:56,630
Keep up to date with
the latest Azure customer

54
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,650
and subscription offers,

55
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,790
and switch to the offers that

56
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,500
provide the greatest
cost-saving benefit.

57
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,980
Apply tags to identify cost owners.

58
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:07,220
Tags help you manage
costs associated with

59
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,425
the different groups of
Azure products and resources.

60
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:11,360
You can apply tags to groups of

61
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,405
Azure products and resources
to organize billing data.

62
00:02:14,405 --> 00:02:15,740
For example, if you run

63
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,780
several virtual machines
for different teams,

64
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:20,420
you can use tags to categorize
costs by department,

65
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:23,675
such as human resources,
marketing, or finance.

66
00:02:23,675 --> 00:02:25,730
Tags make it easy to identify

67
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,560
groups that generate
the biggest Azure costs,

68
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,540
so you can adjust
your spending accordingly.

69
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,475
Azure Cost Management.

70
00:02:33,475 --> 00:02:36,050
Cost Management is an Azure product

71
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,045
that provides a set of
tools for monitoring,

72
00:02:38,045 --> 00:02:40,790
allocating, and optimizing
your Azure costs.

73
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:43,310
The main features of
the Azure Cost Management tool

74
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,509
include Reporting,

75
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:47,890
Data enrichment,

76
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:49,990
Budgets,

77
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:51,790
Alerting,

78
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:53,940
Recommendations,

79
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,200
and Price.
