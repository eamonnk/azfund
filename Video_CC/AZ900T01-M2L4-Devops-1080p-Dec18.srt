1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:04,665
DevOps brings together people,
processes and technology,

2
00:00:04,665 --> 00:00:08,955
automating software delivery to
provide continuous value to users.

3
00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:11,910
Azure DevOps services
allow you to create,

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:14,910
build and release pipelines that
provide continuous integration,

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,505
delivery and deployment
for your applications.

6
00:00:17,505 --> 00:00:20,850
You can integrate repositories
and application tests,

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:24,275
perform application monitoring,
and work with build artifacts.

8
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:27,110
You can also work with
backlog items for tracking,

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,110
automate infrastructure deployments,
and integrate a range of

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,635
third party tools and services
such as Jenkins and Chef.

11
00:00:33,635 --> 00:00:35,960
All of these functions
and many more are

12
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,940
closely integrated with
Azure to allow for

13
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,040
consistent repeatable deployments for

14
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,540
your applications to provide

15
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,715
streamlined build and
release processes.

16
00:00:43,715 --> 00:00:46,700
Some of the main DevOps services
available with Azure are:

17
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,505
Azure DevOps Services.

18
00:00:48,505 --> 00:00:50,030
Azure DevOps Services,

19
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,375
formerly known as Visual
Studio Team Services or VSTS,

20
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:55,640
provides development
collaboration tools,

21
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:57,530
including high performance pipelines,

22
00:00:57,530 --> 00:00:59,435
free private git repositories,

23
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:01,560
configurable Kanban boards, and

24
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:04,830
extensive automated and
cloud-based load testing.

25
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:06,765
Azure DevTestLabs.

26
00:01:06,765 --> 00:01:09,965
Azure DevTestLabs is a service
that helps developers and testers

27
00:01:09,965 --> 00:01:11,705
quickly create environments in Azure

28
00:01:11,705 --> 00:01:14,180
while minimizing waste
and controlling costs.

29
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,650
Users can test their latest

30
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:17,840
application versions by
quickly provisioning

31
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,670
Windows and Linux environments using

32
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,750
reusable templates and artifacts.

33
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,020
You can easily integrate
your deployment pipeline with

34
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:27,200
DevTestLabs to provision
on-demand environments.
