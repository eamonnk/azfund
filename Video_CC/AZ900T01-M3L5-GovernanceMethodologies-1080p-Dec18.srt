00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
>> Azure Policy is a service in
Azure that you use to create,

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:04,650
assign, and manage policies.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:06,660
These policies enforce
different rules

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,100
and effects over your resources.

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:09,990
So, those resources stay
compliant which are

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,930
corporate standards and
service-level agreements.

7
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:16,665
Azure Policy does this by using
policies and initiatives.

8
00:00:16,665 --> 00:00:19,260
The journey of creating and
implementing a policy in

9
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:22,125
Azure Policy begins with
creating a policy definition.

10
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:26,130
Every policy definition has
conditions under which is enforced.

11
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,200
It has an accompanying effect that

12
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,495
takes place if
the conditions are met.

13
00:00:30,495 --> 00:00:32,610
The process of applying
a policy to your

14
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,995
resources consist of
the following steps.

15
00:00:34,995 --> 00:00:37,560
Firstly, create a policy definition.

16
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,025
Secondly, assign a definition
to a scope of resources.

17
00:00:41,025 --> 00:00:44,405
Thirdly, view
policy evaluation results.

18
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:47,710
Examples of policy
definitions would include,

19
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,830
Allowed Storage Account SKUs.

20
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,070
To this policy definition
has a set of conditions and

21
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:54,080
rules that the term
better storage account,

22
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:56,945
that is being applied is
within a set of SKU sizes.

23
00:00:56,945 --> 00:00:59,480
It's effect is to deny
all storage accounts that

24
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:02,380
do not adhere to the set
of defined SKU sizes.

25
00:01:02,380 --> 00:01:04,180
Allowed Resource Types.

26
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,140
This policy definition
has a set of conditions

27
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:07,970
and rules to specify
the resource types,

28
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:09,605
that your organization can apply.

29
00:01:09,605 --> 00:01:11,240
Its effect is to deny

30
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,195
all resources that are not
part of this defined list.

31
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:17,160
Allowed Locations. This policy
enable you to restrict

32
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,710
the location such organizations could

33
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,570
specify when deploying resources.

34
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:22,370
Its effect is used to enforce

35
00:01:22,370 --> 00:01:24,785
your geographic
compliance requirements.

36
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:27,115
Allowed Virtual Machines SKUs.

37
00:01:27,115 --> 00:01:30,290
This policy enables you to
specify a set of VM SKUs,

38
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:32,760
that your organization can apply.

39
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,950
Initiatives work alongside
policies in Azure Policy.

40
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,875
An initiative definition is
a set of policy definitions

41
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:43,025
that help track your compliance
state for larger goal.

42
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:44,720
Even if you have a single policy,

43
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,640
we recommend using initiatives if you

44
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,640
anticipate increasing the number
of policies over time.

45
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,590
Like a policy assignment,

46
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,820
an initiative assignment is

47
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:55,385
an initiative definition
assigned to a specific scope.

48
00:01:55,385 --> 00:01:57,470
Initiative assignments
reduce the need to

49
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:59,795
make several initiative
definitions for each scope.

50
00:01:59,795 --> 00:02:01,820
This scope could also range from

51
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,635
managing group, to a resource group.

52
00:02:03,635 --> 00:02:06,900
Initiatives can be assigned
just as policies can.

53
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,870
Role-based access control provides

54
00:02:09,870 --> 00:02:12,680
fine-grained access management
for Azure resources,

55
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,470
enabling you to grant users only

56
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,760
the rights they need
to perform their jobs.

57
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:21,740
RBAC is provided at no additional
cost to all Azure subscribers.

58
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,170
Examples of when you
might use RBAC include,

59
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,500
when you want to allow a user to
manage VMs in a subscription.

60
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,005
I'm not a user to manage
virtual networks.

61
00:02:32,005 --> 00:02:34,090
Allow a database
administrator group to

62
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,585
manage SQL databases
in a subscription.

63
00:02:36,585 --> 00:02:38,980
Allow user to manage all resources in

64
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,965
resource groups such as
VMs, websites, and subnets.

65
00:02:41,965 --> 00:02:46,150
Allow an application to access
all resources in a resource group.

66
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:49,420
To view access permissions,

67
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,760
access the access control,

68
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:52,665
the IAM blade in the Azure portal.

69
00:02:52,665 --> 00:02:56,330
On this blade, you can see who has
access to an area under a role.

70
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:57,410
Using the same blade,

71
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:00,180
you can grant or remove access.

72
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,350
Locks help you prevent
accidental deletion

73
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:05,180
or modification of
your Azure resources.

74
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:07,895
You can manage these locks
from it in the Azure portal.

75
00:03:07,895 --> 00:03:09,620
To view out or delete locks,

76
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:13,390
go to the settings section of
Azure resources, Settings Blade.

77
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:16,305
You may need to lock
a subscription, resource group,

78
00:03:16,305 --> 00:03:18,800
or resource to prevent other users
in your organization from

79
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,385
accidentally deleting or
modifying critical resources.

80
00:03:22,385 --> 00:03:27,055
You can set the lock level to
"CanNotDelete" or "ReadOnly".

81
00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:29,570
CanNotDelete, means authorized users

82
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:31,430
can still read and modify resource,

83
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,215
but they can't delete the resource.

84
00:03:33,215 --> 00:03:36,590
ReadOnly means authorized users
can read a resource,

85
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:39,355
but they can't delete
or update the resource.

86
00:03:39,355 --> 00:03:41,955
In the Azure portal,
the locks are called

87
00:03:41,955 --> 00:03:44,920
"Delete" and "Read-only"
respectively.

88
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,940
As discussed earlier in the course,

89
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,940
I should advise you as
a free service built into

90
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:52,280
Azure that provides recommendations
on high availability,

91
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,395
security performance, and cost.

92
00:03:54,395 --> 00:03:56,910
Advisor analyzes
your deployed services,

93
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:58,040
and looks for ways to improve

94
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:00,415
your environment across
these four areas.

95
00:04:00,415 --> 00:04:03,390
Azure Advisor provides
security recommendations,

96
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,470
by integrating
the Azure Security Center.

97
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:07,690
You can view the security
center recommendations

98
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:10,165
on the Security tab of
the Advisor dashboard.

99
00:04:10,165 --> 00:04:11,650
You can then click deeper into

100
00:04:11,650 --> 00:04:13,315
the Security Center Recommendations.

101
00:04:13,315 --> 00:04:15,850
Azure Blueprint is a declarative way
to orchestrate deployment

102
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,730
of various resource templates
and other artifacts.

103
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,410
But Azure Blueprint, the relationship

104
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,910
between the blueprint definition,

105
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,230
what should be deployed,

106
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:24,530
and the blueprint assignment,

107
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,790
what was deployed is preserved.

108
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,200
Disconnection supports
improved deployment tracking

109
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,365
and auditing. Usage scenario.

110
00:04:32,365 --> 00:04:35,340
Adhering to security or
compliance requirements whether

111
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,510
government or industry can be
difficult and time consuming.

112
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,690
To help you at
auditing, traceability,

113
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:41,205
and compliance with your deployments,

114
00:04:41,205 --> 00:04:43,515
use Azure Blueprint
artifacts and tools.

115
00:04:43,515 --> 00:04:45,430
Time-consuming paperwork is no longer

116
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:48,340
needed and your part to
certification is expedited.

117
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,420
Note that the time of
writing this course,

118
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:53,870
Azure Blueprint is in preview and
has not been released generally.
