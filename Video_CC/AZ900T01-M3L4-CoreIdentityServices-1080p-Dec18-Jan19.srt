00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,950
>> Two fundamental concepts
that need to be

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:03,930
understood when talking
about identity and access,

3
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:05,925
are authentication and authorization.

4
00:00:05,925 --> 00:00:08,190
They all depend everything
else that happens on a course

5
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:10,980
sequentially in on Identity
and access process.

6
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,960
Authentication is the process of

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,180
establishing the identity
of a person or service,

8
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:16,845
looking to access a resource.

9
00:00:16,845 --> 00:00:18,540
It involves the act of challenging

10
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:20,220
a party for legitimate credentials,

11
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,650
and provides the basis for
creating a security principle,

12
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,555
for identity and access control use.

13
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:27,405
It establishes if they
are, who they say they're.

14
00:00:27,405 --> 00:00:30,270
Authorization is the process
of establishing what level of

15
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,880
access and authenticated
person or service has,

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,310
it specifies what data
they're allowed to access and

17
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:37,830
what they can do with it.

18
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,940
Azure Active Directory, is

19
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,150
a Microsoft Cloud based Identity
and access management service.

20
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:44,955
Azure AD, helps employees
of an organization,

21
00:00:44,955 --> 00:00:48,980
sign in and access
external and internal resources.

22
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,310
External resources might include;

23
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,180
Microsoft Office 365,
the Azure Portal,

24
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:56,205
an other SaaS applications.

25
00:00:56,205 --> 00:00:58,380
Internal resources might include;

26
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:00,310
apps on your corporate
network and intranet,

27
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:03,950
along with any cloud apps developed
by your own organization.

28
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,650
Azure AD provide services such
as: Authentication is includes;

29
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,540
verified identity to access
applications and resources,

30
00:01:11,540 --> 00:01:13,340
and providing functionality, such as;

31
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:17,080
Self-Service Password Reset and
Multifactor Authentication.

32
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,335
Single-Sign-On.
Single-Sign-On enables users

33
00:01:21,335 --> 00:01:22,880
to remember only one ID and

34
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,595
one password to access
multiple applications.

35
00:01:25,595 --> 00:01:28,400
Application management, manager cloud

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,310
and on-premises applications.

37
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:32,895
Business to business
identity services,

38
00:01:32,895 --> 00:01:35,360
manage your guest users
and external partners

39
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,665
by maintaining control over
your own corporate data.

40
00:01:38,665 --> 00:01:41,095
Business to customer
identity services,

41
00:01:41,095 --> 00:01:43,505
customize and control
how users sign up,

42
00:01:43,505 --> 00:01:47,710
sign-in and monitor profiles when
using your apps and services.

43
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:50,645
Device management,
manage how your cloud

44
00:01:50,645 --> 00:01:54,030
or on-premises devices
access your corporate data.

45
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,880
Multifactor Authentication,
provides additional security for

46
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:00,050
your identities by acquiring

47
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,990
two or more elements for
full authentication.

48
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:07,235
These elements fall into three
categories: Something you know,

49
00:02:07,235 --> 00:02:10,115
it could be a password or
the answer to security question.

50
00:02:10,115 --> 00:02:12,470
Something you possess, might be

51
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,670
a mobile app that receives

52
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,280
a notification or
a token generating device,

53
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,900
and something you are, is

54
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:19,880
typically some sort of
bio-metric property,

55
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,875
such as, a fingerprint or face scan,

56
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:23,885
use on many mobile devices.

57
00:02:23,885 --> 00:02:26,450
Using MFA increases identity security

58
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,730
by limiting the impact
of credential exposure.

59
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:31,370
To fully authenticate,
an attacker who has

60
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:33,350
a user's password would
also need to have

61
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:36,245
possession of their phone or
their fingerprint for example.

62
00:02:36,245 --> 00:02:39,590
In this case, authentication
with only a single factor is

63
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:41,450
insufficient and the attacker will be

64
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:43,775
unable to use those credentials
to authenticate.

65
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:46,250
MFA should be enabled
wherever possible,

66
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,130
as MFA adds enormous
benefits to security.
