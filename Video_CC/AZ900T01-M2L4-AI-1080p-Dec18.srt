00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,750
>> Artificial intelligence, in
the context of cloud computing,

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:05,160
is based around the broad range of

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,160
services the core of which
is machine learning.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,665
Machine learning is a
data science technique

5
00:00:10,665 --> 00:00:11,940
that allows computers to use

6
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,365
existing data to forecast future
behaviors, outcomes, and trends.

7
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:18,210
Using machine learning, computers

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:20,955
learn without being
explicitly programmed.

9
00:00:20,955 --> 00:00:22,940
Forecasts or predictions for

10
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:25,370
machine learning can make
apps and devices smarter.

11
00:00:25,370 --> 00:00:27,425
For example, when you shop online,

12
00:00:27,425 --> 00:00:29,390
machine learning helps
recommend other products

13
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:31,820
you might like based on
what you've purchased.

14
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,680
Or when your credit card is swiped,

15
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,480
machine learning compares
the transaction to

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,945
a database of transactions
and helps detect fraud.

17
00:00:38,945 --> 00:00:41,930
When your robot vacuum cleaner
vacuums the room,

18
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:45,240
machine learning helps to
decide whether the job is done.

19
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,720
Some of the most common artificial

20
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,690
intelligence and machine
learning service types in Azure are,

21
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:52,970
Azure Machine Learning Service,

22
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,680
Azure Machine Learning
Service provides

23
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:57,605
a cloud-based environment you
can use to develop, train,

24
00:00:57,605 --> 00:01:02,650
test, deploy, manage, and
track machine learning models.

25
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:05,930
It fully supports open source
technologies so you can use

26
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,340
tens of thousands of
open source Python packages

27
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,440
with machine learning components.

28
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,350
Azure Machine Learning Service can

29
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:15,020
auto-generate a model
on auto-tune for you.

30
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:16,430
It'll let you start training on

31
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,135
your local machine and then
you can scale up to the Cloud.

32
00:01:20,135 --> 00:01:22,735
Azure Machine Learning Studio,

33
00:01:22,735 --> 00:01:25,460
Azure Machine Learning Studio
is a collaborative drag

34
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,860
and drop visual work space
where you can build,

35
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,410
test and deploy
machine learning solutions

36
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:32,545
without needing to write code.

37
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:35,070
It uses pre-built and pre-configured

38
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,255
machine learning algorithms
on data handling modules.

39
00:01:38,255 --> 00:01:40,580
Use Machine Learning Studio
when you want to

40
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:44,000
experiment with machine
learning models quickly and easily.
