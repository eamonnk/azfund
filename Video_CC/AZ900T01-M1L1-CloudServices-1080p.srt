1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:02,820
>> Cloud Computing is the delivery of

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,170
various computing services over

3
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:06,225
the internet to offer
faster innovation,

4
00:00:06,225 --> 00:00:08,985
flexible resources, and
economies of scale,

5
00:00:08,985 --> 00:00:12,390
you typically only pay for the
services that you consume.

6
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,910
Cloud Computing helps you
run your business more

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:17,310
efficiently and to scale
up and down as you need,

8
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,620
and grow as your business changes.

9
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:22,020
Cloud services is a big shift from

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,290
the traditional way businesses
think about IT resources.

11
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:29,399
Some of the main characteristics
include; high availability,

12
00:00:29,399 --> 00:00:31,830
which is the ability to keep
services up and running for

13
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:35,490
long periods of time with very
little, if any, downtime.

14
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,980
Scalability. The ability to increase

15
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,665
our decrease resources
for any given workload.

16
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:43,220
Elasticity. The ability to

17
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,325
increase or decrease resources
as needed automatically.

18
00:00:46,325 --> 00:00:50,660
Agility. The ability to react
quickly. Disaster recovery.

19
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,415
The ability to recover from an event

20
00:00:52,415 --> 00:00:54,590
which is taken down
a product or a service.

21
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:58,310
Global reach. The ability to
reach audiences around the globe.

22
00:00:58,310 --> 00:01:01,340
Security. Many
Cloud providers can provide

23
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:02,990
better security services than

24
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,310
you could otherwise achieve yourself.

25
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,050
There are two important factors
to consider when

26
00:01:09,050 --> 00:01:11,570
considering the costs
of Cloud services.

27
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,195
Firstly, economies of scale.

28
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:17,300
The concept of economies of scale
is the ability to do things more

29
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:20,635
cheaply and efficiently by
operating at a large scale.

30
00:01:20,635 --> 00:01:23,280
Cloud providers such
as Microsoft, Google,

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,745
and Amazon are working
on a huge scale,

32
00:01:25,745 --> 00:01:28,310
and are able to leverage
the benefits of economies of

33
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:30,815
scale and pass those benefits
on that our customers.

34
00:01:30,815 --> 00:01:33,820
Is it apparent to end
uses in a number of ways?

35
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,470
One of which is their ability
to acquire hardware more

36
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,335
cheaply than if a single user
or smaller business,

37
00:01:39,335 --> 00:01:41,790
or purchasing it themselves.

38
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:45,800
Secondly, does capital expenditure
on operational expenditure.

39
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,990
Capital expenditure
is the spending of

40
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:50,105
money on physical
infrastructure upfront.

41
00:01:50,105 --> 00:01:53,165
That's how new businesses would
have traditionally operated.

42
00:01:53,165 --> 00:01:56,000
Operational expenditure is
the spending of money on

43
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,970
services or products and being
billed for them as you use them.

44
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:02,150
Getting access to money up front

45
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,560
can be a severe limiting factor for

46
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,360
businesses and prevent
new companies or

47
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,360
new services and products
ever getting off the ground.

48
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,000
The fact that you can
start up a new service

49
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,010
and pay only for what you use with

50
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:15,170
no need for big upfront capital costs

51
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,220
has dramatically changed
the business landscape,

52
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,245
and allows new companies to get up
and running relatively quickly.

53
00:02:21,245 --> 00:02:24,860
Cloud services operate on
a consumption-based model,

54
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:29,730
which means that users only pay
for the resources that they use.
