00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:05,250
It began at a personal
digital assistants,

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,800
PDAs then more often to smartphones.

4
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,405
Now there are smart watches,

5
00:00:09,405 --> 00:00:12,195
smart thermostat and
even smart refrigerators.

6
00:00:12,195 --> 00:00:14,445
Personal computers used to the norm.

7
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:16,770
Now the internet
allows any item that's

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,650
online capable to access
valuable information.

9
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,950
This ability for devices to garner
and then relay information for

10
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,925
data analysis is referred to
as the Internet of Things.

11
00:00:26,925 --> 00:00:29,340
There are a number of
services that can assist and

12
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,010
drive end-to-end solutions
for IoT and Azure.

13
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:36,945
Two of the Core Azure IoT services
are: IoT Central.

14
00:00:36,945 --> 00:00:40,260
IoT Central is a fully
managed global IoT software

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,780
as a service solution that
makes it easy to connect,

16
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:46,190
monitor, and manage
your IoT assets at scale.

17
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:49,505
No Cloud expertise is
required to use IoT Central.

18
00:00:49,505 --> 00:00:51,980
As a result, you can bring
your connected products to

19
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:55,830
market foster while staying
focused on your customers.

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,035
Azure IoT Hub, Azure IoT Hub

21
00:01:00,035 --> 00:01:02,600
is a managed service hosted
in the Cloud that acts as

22
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,180
a central message job for
bidirectional communication

23
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,765
between your IoT application
and the devices it manages.

24
00:01:08,765 --> 00:01:12,260
You can use Azure IoT Hub
to build IoT solutions with

25
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,020
reliable and secure
communications to millions of

26
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:18,320
IoT devices on a cloud
hosted solution back-end.

27
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,930
You can connect virtually
any device to IoT Hub.
