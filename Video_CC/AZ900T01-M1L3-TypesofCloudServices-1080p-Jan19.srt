1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
>> Infrastructure-as-a-Service
is the most basic category

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,485
of Cloud computing services.

3
00:00:04,485 --> 00:00:06,015
With IaaS, you rent

4
00:00:06,015 --> 00:00:08,595
IT infrastructure servers,
and virtual machines,

5
00:00:08,595 --> 00:00:11,010
storage networks,
operating systems from

6
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,530
a Cloud provider on a pay
for what you use basis.

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,959
It is an instant
computing infrastructure,

8
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:19,175
provisioned and managed over
secure Internet connection.

9
00:00:19,175 --> 00:00:21,259
Using a virtual machine servers,

10
00:00:21,259 --> 00:00:22,320
to run an operating system in

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,135
the cloud will be an example of IaaS.

12
00:00:25,135 --> 00:00:28,610
Platform-as-a-Service, provides
an environment for building,

13
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:31,085
testing, and deploying
software applications.

14
00:00:31,085 --> 00:00:33,080
The goal of PaaS, is to help

15
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,730
you create an application
as quickly as

16
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:36,350
possible without having to worry

17
00:00:36,350 --> 00:00:38,585
about managing the
underlying infrastructure.

18
00:00:38,585 --> 00:00:41,925
For example, when deploying
a Web application using PaaS,

19
00:00:41,925 --> 00:00:43,820
you don't have to install
an operating system,

20
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,130
Web server, or even system updates.

21
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,440
It's a complete development
and deployment environment

22
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,630
into Cloud with resources that enable

23
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,515
you to deliver everything
from simple Cloud-based apps

24
00:00:53,515 --> 00:00:57,595
to sophisticated Cloud enabled
enterprise applications.

25
00:00:57,595 --> 00:00:59,540
Resources are purchased from

26
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,490
a Cloud service provider
in a pay for what

27
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:05,600
you use basis and accessed over
secure Internet connection.

28
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,450
Running a website and a platform such

29
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,920
as Azure Web Apps would
be an example of PaaS.

30
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,960
Software-as-a-Service,
is software that

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,975
is essentially hosted and
managed for customers.

32
00:01:14,975 --> 00:01:16,610
It allows users to connect to and

33
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:18,950
use Cloud-based apps
over the Internet.

34
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:21,590
How many examples are
email, calendaring,

35
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,585
Office tools, such as
Microsoft Office 365.

36
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:28,740
It is typically licensed to a
monthly or an annual subscription.
