00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,965
>> When we are talking
about big data,

2
00:00:01,965 --> 00:00:03,915
we're referring to
large volumes of data.

3
00:00:03,915 --> 00:00:06,360
Data from weather systems,
communication systems,

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,415
imaging platforms, and
many other scenarios

5
00:00:08,415 --> 00:00:10,290
generate large amounts of data.

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,330
This amount of data
becomes increasingly

7
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:14,490
hard to make sense of and
make decisions around.

8
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,040
The volumes are so large that
traditional data forms of

9
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,095
processing and analysis
are no longer appropriate.

10
00:00:20,095 --> 00:00:23,130
Microsoft Azure supports
a broad range of technologies and

11
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:27,255
services to provide Big Data
and analytic solutions.

12
00:00:27,255 --> 00:00:30,410
So the most common big data
and analytics service types in

13
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,620
Azure are: Azure SQL Data Warehouse.

14
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:35,210
Azure SQL Data Warehouse is

15
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,910
a cloud-based enterprise data
warehouse that leverages

16
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,730
massively parallel
processing (MPP) to run

17
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:43,930
complex queries quickly
across petabytes of data.

18
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,425
Once data is stored in
SQL Data Warehouse,

19
00:00:46,425 --> 00:00:48,935
you can run analytics
on massive scale.

20
00:00:48,935 --> 00:00:51,305
Compared to traditional
database systems,

21
00:00:51,305 --> 00:00:54,035
analysis queries finish in
seconds instead of minutes,

22
00:00:54,035 --> 00:00:56,335
or hours instead of days.

23
00:00:56,335 --> 00:00:58,530
Azure HDInsight.

24
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:00,080
Azure HDInsight is

25
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,215
a fully managed open-source
analytic service for enterprises.

26
00:01:03,215 --> 00:01:05,930
It is a cloud service that
makes it easier, faster,

27
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:09,390
and more cost effective to
process massive amounts of data.

28
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:11,300
HDInsights allow you to run

29
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,430
popular open-source
frameworks and create

30
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,740
cluster types such as Apache Spark,

31
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:18,125
Apache Hadoop, Apache Kafka,

32
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,540
Apache HBase, Apache Storm,

33
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,325
and Machine Learning service.

34
00:01:22,325 --> 00:01:24,305
Azure Data Lake analytics.

35
00:01:24,305 --> 00:01:25,970
Azure Data Lake Analytics is

36
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,540
an on-demand analytics job service
that simplifies big data.

37
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,600
Instead of deploying,
configuring, and tuning hardware,

38
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,160
you write queries to transform

39
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:36,590
your data and extract
valuable insights.

40
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,960
The analytic service can
handle jobs of any scale

41
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,840
instantly by setting the dial
for how much power unit.

42
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:44,240
You only pay for your job
when it is running,

43
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:46,400
making it more cost-effective
