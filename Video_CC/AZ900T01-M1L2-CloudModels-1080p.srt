1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,800
>> A public cloud is owned and

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,720
operated by a cloud service provider.

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:05,640
They provide resources
and services to

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:07,530
multiple organizations
and users which

5
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,090
connect to the Cloud service via

6
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,250
secure narrow connection,
typically over the internet.

7
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:15,555
Public cloud characteristics
would include;

8
00:00:15,555 --> 00:00:17,370
resources such as storage,

9
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:18,690
processing, power, et cetera,

10
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,030
do not belong to the organisation

11
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:21,545
or users that is using the resource,

12
00:00:21,545 --> 00:00:25,090
rather they are owned and operated
by the cloud service provider.

13
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:26,790
The Cloud service provider is

14
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:28,260
entirely responsible
for the purchase,

15
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,930
maintenance, and management
of the Cloud hardware.

16
00:00:30,930 --> 00:00:32,840
Resources would be made available to

17
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,515
multiple organizations and end-users.

18
00:00:35,515 --> 00:00:38,210
Typically, it's connected to security

19
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:40,760
over the internet
using a web browser.

20
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:43,455
It is accessible to the public.

21
00:00:43,455 --> 00:00:45,890
It does not require
deep tech knowledge

22
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,180
to start using public cloud.

23
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:51,200
A private cloud is
owned and operated by

24
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,125
the organization that uses
the resources from the cloud.

25
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:55,730
An organization that creates

26
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:58,130
a private cloud in
it's own data center,

27
00:00:58,130 --> 00:00:59,570
it's completely responsible for

28
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,960
the operation of
the services they provide.

29
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,695
Private cloud characteristics
would include;

30
00:01:04,695 --> 00:01:07,710
the owner and user of
the cloud services are the same,

31
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,430
the owner is entirely
responsible for the purchase,

32
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:12,940
maintenance, and management
of the Cloud hardware.

33
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:15,330
A private cloud operates only within

34
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,970
mono organization and resources are

35
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:19,885
typically used by
a single business or organization.

36
00:01:19,885 --> 00:01:22,430
An action to it is typically by

37
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,925
a private network and
is highly secure.

38
00:01:24,925 --> 00:01:27,435
It is not accessible to the public.

39
00:01:27,435 --> 00:01:30,005
It requires deep technical
knowledge to setup,

40
00:01:30,005 --> 00:01:32,135
manage, and maintain a private cloud.

41
00:01:32,135 --> 00:01:34,460
A Hybrid Cloud combines the use of

42
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,130
both public and private
clouds allowing

43
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,825
you to run your application in
the most appropriate location.

44
00:01:40,825 --> 00:01:45,660
Hybrid cloud characteristics
include; ownership is split.

45
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,450
The cloud provider being responsible

46
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,115
for the public cloud resources

47
00:01:49,115 --> 00:01:50,480
and private cloud organization

48
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,380
responsibly for the operation
of the private cloud.

49
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,610
Specific resources are
run in are used in

50
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:58,260
a public cloud and other resources

51
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,870
are run in are used
in a private cloud.

52
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,370
Allows an organization to leverage
some of the benefits of cost,

53
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:08,605
efficiency, and scale available
with a public cloud model.

54
00:02:08,605 --> 00:02:10,820
Retains and management control

55
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,140
that comes at a private cloud model.

56
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:17,405
Technical skills are still required
to maintain your private cloud

57
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:21,840
and ensure both cloud models
can inter-operate successfully.
