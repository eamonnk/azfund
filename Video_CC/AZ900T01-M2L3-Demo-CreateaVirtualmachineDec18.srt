1
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:05,320
>> So, let's go ahead and create
a Virtual Machine in Azure.

2
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:08,265
First, we log in to the portal,

3
00:00:08,265 --> 00:00:13,485
portal.azure.com,
we're on the homepage.

4
00:00:13,485 --> 00:00:16,425
I'm going to go down to the list
of services on the left,

5
00:00:16,425 --> 00:00:24,520
locate "Virtual Machines" and then
click "Create Virtual Machine."

6
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,985
Then, to create
a virtual machine pane,

7
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:35,510
there's a series of tabs we
need to go through to fill in

8
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:36,710
for the configuration that you

9
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,270
wish to deploy and a virtual machine.

10
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:40,130
The subscription is Free Trial.

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:41,600
We wish to create
a new resource group,

12
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,520
into which we will have
all the resources placed in

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,100
a single location so we can
manage them as a single entity.

14
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:57,450
We'll name it VM1
our virtual machine name,

15
00:00:57,450 --> 00:01:00,220
we'll call it virtualmachin1.

16
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:03,865
We'll take to the fourth
region of East US.

17
00:01:03,865 --> 00:01:06,350
You won't configure
any availability options.

18
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:10,060
For an image, we'll go to
"Browse all images and disks".

19
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,860
I may look for Windows image.

20
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,630
We'll select Windows 10 Pro.

21
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:26,060
Accept the default disk size,

22
00:01:26,060 --> 00:01:28,120
we need to put in
a username and password.

23
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,010
We use username azureuser.

24
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:35,290
Your password needs to meet
the minimum complexity requirements

25
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,790
for Azure and make sure you

26
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:38,590
take note of it as well
because we'll be using

27
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,820
this password to
connect to the virtual

28
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:42,260
machine after it's deployed.

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,425
For "Inbound Port Rules",

30
00:01:49,425 --> 00:01:52,620
we need to allow selected ports.

31
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,570
This is to allow us to connect to

32
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:56,970
the virtual machine
after it's deployed,

33
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,990
and we'll select all
of these ports here.

34
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:06,290
We'll only be connected
over the RDP port,

35
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:11,760
but we'll enable them all here
now. You can click "Next."

36
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:18,120
Accept the defaults for
"Disks" and the defaults for

37
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,025
"Networking" and continue to
accepting that all the defaults,

38
00:02:24,025 --> 00:02:28,350
and then Azure is going to validate
the deployment configuration.

39
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,120
The validation was successful,
and we click "Create".

40
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:38,080
The deployment has now started.

41
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,750
So, we can see all the resources
as they're being

42
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,850
created and we go to
the resource group.

43
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:58,590
You can do that directly
from this deployment pane.

44
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:02,160
Or we can locate "Resource Groups" on

45
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:10,110
the left-hand side and open up
the resource group we just created.

46
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:17,300
In here, we can see
all the resources that

47
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,920
are currently under deployment.

48
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,380
That has successfully deployed.

49
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:39,230
We can see all the resources
that have been deployed

50
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,770
with the virtual machine
itself, the disk,

51
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:45,560
the Network Interface,
the public IP address,

52
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,985
the Network Security Group,

53
00:03:46,985 --> 00:03:50,160
the Storage Account and
the Virtual Network.

54
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:52,730
All of these resources
are required to make

55
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:55,055
that virtual machine
fully functional.

56
00:03:55,055 --> 00:03:57,170
We can access to
virtual machine by opening up

57
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:06,900
the virtual machine and
clicking "Connect".

58
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:12,750
In the "Connect to a
Virtual Machine" pane,

59
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,730
click "Download RDP File",

60
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:19,870
and click "OK" to open.

61
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:29,190
In the RDP connection dialog,

62
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:33,620
click "Connect", enter your username

63
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,880
and password which is specified

64
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,470
when you're configuring
the virtual machine.

65
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,990
In our case it was azureuser.

66
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:46,950
I'm going to use dot backslash to
indicate it's a local account.

67
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,390
Click "Yes" to connect,

68
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:59,740
and that's now logging in
to the virtual machine.

69
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:04,080
You can see that's
a fully functioning virtual machine.

70
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,060
Our virtual machine is now deployed

71
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,685
and available to run our workloads.

72
00:05:25,685 --> 00:05:27,815
Remember that running
virtual machines

73
00:05:27,815 --> 00:05:29,905
are costing money
while they're running,

74
00:05:29,905 --> 00:05:32,495
and you should shut down and
delete the virtual machine.

75
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:35,330
The quickest way to delete
a virtual machine will be to

76
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:38,150
delete "the resource group" and
all the resources within it.

77
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,725
If you're not going to
use the virtual machine,

78
00:05:39,725 --> 00:05:42,470
it would be advisable to
delete a resource group now.
