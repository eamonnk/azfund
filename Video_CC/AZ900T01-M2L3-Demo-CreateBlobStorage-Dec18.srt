1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:03,990
>> So, let's go ahead and
create some blob storage.

2
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:05,685
So, we're logged in
to the Azure portal,

3
00:00:05,685 --> 00:00:10,755
a portal.azure.com.
Run the "Home" page.

4
00:00:10,755 --> 00:00:13,110
We get down the list of
services on the left.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:15,790
We look for "Storage Accounts",

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:20,130
and into "Storage Accounts" pane,

7
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,960
we click "Create Storage Account".

8
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:28,530
With the series of tabs you need to

9
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,960
configure into "Create
Storage Account" pane.

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,355
Subscription is free trial.

11
00:00:32,355 --> 00:00:34,690
We create a new "Resource Group",

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:41,970
we call it blobrg1.

13
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,330
We need a storage account name,

14
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,050
and it needs to be
a unique name across Azure.

15
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:50,620
If you append your initials or
something like that to the name,

16
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,310
that may help to make it unique.

17
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,740
Blobstrek03, we'll take
the default location,

18
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,750
"Standard" performance, and for

19
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:00,090
"Account kind'' we'll
select "BlobStorage".

20
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,200
Take the defaults, let it complete

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,680
the validation which
will run successfully,

22
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,090
and then click ''Create''.

23
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,540
That deployment has succeeded.

24
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:24,285
We'll go to a ''Resource Group'',

25
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:27,310
open our storage account.

26
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,810
Let's scroll down to "Blob
Service" and then "Blobs".

27
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,380
Next, we need to create a
container when in blob storage.

28
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,190
We've got a blob container.

29
00:01:55,010 --> 00:01:57,435
For public access level,

30
00:01:57,435 --> 00:02:02,290
we'll select ''Anonymous Read
Access for Containers and Blobs''.

31
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:15,910
Click ''OK''. So, if we
open up blob container now,

32
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:27,315
you want to upload some files
to it, click ''Upload''.

33
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:39,600
Browse some file startup,
click ''Upload''.

34
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:45,100
We can see the file we uploaded at
blob storage is available here.

35
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,370
Click on the ''... ''.

36
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:50,430
We can open up an access to
content in the blob file.

37
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:53,530
If you go to ''Blob Properties'',

38
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,640
copy the "URL", drop
it into a browser.

39
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:06,200
So, that blob storage content

40
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,150
is now available
globally via that URL.
