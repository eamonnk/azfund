00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,530
>> Azure Storage is a service
that you can use to store files,

2
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:06,120
messages, tables, and
other types of information.

3
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:08,040
You can use Azure Storage on its own,

4
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,555
for example, as a file share.

5
00:00:09,555 --> 00:00:13,110
But developers also often use
it as a store for working data.

6
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,065
Such stores can be used
by websites, mobile apps,

7
00:00:16,065 --> 00:00:19,425
desktop applications, and many
other types of custom solutions.

8
00:00:19,425 --> 00:00:21,570
Azure Storage is also used by IaaS

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,495
virtual machines and
PaaS cloud services.

10
00:00:24,495 --> 00:00:28,425
You can generally think of
Azure Storage in categories.

11
00:00:28,425 --> 00:00:30,840
First, in the structured data.

12
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:33,075
Structured data adheres to a schema,

13
00:00:33,075 --> 00:00:35,670
so all of the data has
the same fields or properties.

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,230
Structured data can be stored in

15
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:40,220
a database table with
rows and columns.

16
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:42,895
Secondly, semi-structured data.

17
00:00:42,895 --> 00:00:45,150
Semi-structured data
is less organized than

18
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,850
structured data and is not
stored in a relational format,

19
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,580
meaning the fields do not need to fit

20
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,845
into tables, rows, and columns.

21
00:00:51,845 --> 00:00:54,110
Semi-structured data
is also referred to as

22
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:57,090
non-relational or NoSQL data.

23
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,940
Thirdly, unstructured data.

24
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:01,920
Unstructured data encompasses data

25
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,665
that has no designated
structure to it.

26
00:01:03,665 --> 00:01:04,910
This also means that there are

27
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:07,055
no restrictions in the kinds
of data it can hold.

28
00:01:07,055 --> 00:01:09,715
For example, a blob can
hold a PDF document,

29
00:01:09,715 --> 00:01:13,350
a JPEG image, a JSON file,
or video content.

30
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,280
As such, unstructured data
is becoming more prominent

31
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:19,520
as businesses try to tap
into new data sources.

32
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,860
Some of the most common
storage service types in

33
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:24,435
Azure are: Blob Storage.

34
00:01:24,435 --> 00:01:26,355
Azure Blob Storage is unstructured,

35
00:01:26,355 --> 00:01:29,510
meaning that there are no
restrictions in the data it can hold.

36
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,890
Blobs are highly scalable

37
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:32,600
an absorber blobs in
much the same way as

38
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,740
they would work with files on

39
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,780
a disc such as reading
and writing data.

40
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,985
Blob storage can manage thousands
of simultaneous uploads,

41
00:01:38,985 --> 00:01:40,590
massive amounts of video data,

42
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:42,500
constantly growing log files and

43
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,320
can be reached from anywhere
with an Internet connection.

44
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:48,150
Disk storage. Disk storage provides

45
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,180
disk for virtual machines,
applications,

46
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,490
and other services to
access and use they need,

47
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:55,835
similar to how they would
in an on-premises scenario.

48
00:01:55,835 --> 00:01:58,400
Disk storage allows
data to be persistently

49
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,010
stored and accessed from
unattached virtual hard disks.

50
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:04,055
Disks come in many different sizes
and performance levels,

51
00:02:04,055 --> 00:02:05,585
from solid-state drives to

52
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:07,610
traditional spinning hard disk drives

53
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:10,150
with varying performance abilities.

54
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:14,220
File storage. Azure files offer
fully managed file shares in

55
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,560
the cloud that are accessible via

56
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,790
the Industry Standard Server
message Block SMB protocol.

57
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,200
Azure files shares can
be mounted concurrently

58
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:23,480
by Cloud or on-premises
deployments of Windows,

59
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,835
Linux, or MacOS. Archive storage.

60
00:02:28,835 --> 00:02:31,070
Archive storage provides
a storage facility

61
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,660
for data that is rarely accessed.

62
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,840
It allows you to archive
legacy data at low cost,

63
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,080
to what would
traditionally have costed,

64
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,000
to create and maintain archives.

65
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,860
It is stored offline and offers
the lowest storage costs.

66
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:43,335
However, it is also
the highest access cost,

67
00:02:43,335 --> 00:02:47,200
hence it is suited for archival data
that is rarely accessed.
