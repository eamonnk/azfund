00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,820
>> Azure Compute is
an on-demand computing service

2
00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:04,650
for running Cloud-based applications.

3
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,005
Provides computing
resources such as disks,

4
00:00:07,005 --> 00:00:10,395
processors, memory, networking,
and operating systems.

5
00:00:10,395 --> 00:00:12,190
The resources are
available on demand,

6
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,030
and can typically be made available
in minutes or even seconds.

7
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:16,680
You pay only for the resources you

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,685
use and only for as long
as you're using them.

9
00:00:19,685 --> 00:00:22,580
There are two common service types
for performing compute in

10
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:25,450
Azure: virtual machines
and containers.

11
00:00:25,450 --> 00:00:27,585
Let's look at virtual machines first.

12
00:00:27,585 --> 00:00:29,565
So, what is the virtual machine?

13
00:00:29,565 --> 00:00:31,925
Virtual machines or VMs

14
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:34,700
are software emulations
of physical computers.

15
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,515
They include a virtual processor,

16
00:00:36,515 --> 00:00:39,035
memory storage, and
networking resources.

17
00:00:39,035 --> 00:00:41,270
They host an operating system
and you're able to

18
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:44,210
install and run software just
like a physical computer.

19
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,100
Azure supports a wide range of

20
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:48,200
computing solutions including Linux,

21
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,300
Windows Server, Microsoft SQL Server,

22
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,030
Oracle, IBM and SAP.

23
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,060
Examples of some core
Azure Compute services for

24
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:59,535
virtual machines would be
Azure Virtual Machines.

25
00:00:59,535 --> 00:01:03,130
Azure VMs lets you create and use
virtual machines in the Cloud,

26
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:04,840
provides infrastructure as a service

27
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:07,165
and can be used in a variety
of different ways.

28
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:08,710
When you need total control over

29
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,300
an operating system and environment,

30
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:12,400
Azure VMs are an ideal choice.

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,140
Just like a physical computer,

32
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:17,240
you're able to customize all of
the software running on the VM.

33
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,095
VM Scale Sets.

34
00:01:19,095 --> 00:01:20,790
Virtual Machines Scale Sets are

35
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,810
an Azure Compute resource
that you can use to

36
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:25,210
deploy and manage a set
of identical VMs.

37
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,100
With all VMs configured the same,

38
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:30,110
VM Scale Sets are designed
to support true autoscale,

39
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,545
and makes it easier to
build large scale services

40
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:34,735
targeting big compute and big data.

41
00:01:34,735 --> 00:01:37,660
As demand goes up, more
virtual machine instances

42
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,850
can be added and as
the demand goes down,

43
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,980
virtual machine instances
can be removed.

44
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:45,970
Now, let's look at
the second common service type when

45
00:01:45,970 --> 00:01:48,880
dealing with Azure Compute,
namely containers.

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,980
So, what are containers?

47
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,365
Containers are a
virtualization environment.

48
00:01:53,365 --> 00:01:55,050
However, unlike virtual machines,

49
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,095
they do not include
an operating system.

50
00:01:57,095 --> 00:01:59,380
Instead, they reference
the operating system

51
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,465
of the host environment
that runs the container.

52
00:02:01,465 --> 00:02:03,250
Containers are meant
to be lightweight

53
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,525
and are designed to be created,

54
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:06,595
scaled out, and stopped dynamically.

55
00:02:06,595 --> 00:02:09,190
This allows you to respond
to changes on demand and

56
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:12,475
quickly restart in case of
a crash or hardware interruption.

57
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:15,130
Examples of some core
Azure Compute Services

58
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,555
for containers would be.

59
00:02:16,555 --> 00:02:18,660
Azure Container Instances,

60
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,060
Azure Container Instances offers
the fastest and simplest way

61
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,340
to run a container in Azure
without having to manage

62
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:27,665
any virtual machines or adopt
any additional services.

63
00:02:27,665 --> 00:02:30,830
It is a PaaS offering that allows
you to upload your containers,

64
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:35,075
which you're going to run for
you. Azure Kubernetes Service.

65
00:02:35,075 --> 00:02:37,880
A task of automating and
managing a large number of

66
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,725
containers on how do you interact
is known as Orchestration.

67
00:02:41,725 --> 00:02:43,850
Azure Kubernetes Service is

68
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:46,100
a complete orchestration
service for containers,

69
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,800
with distributed architectures
and large volumes of containers.
