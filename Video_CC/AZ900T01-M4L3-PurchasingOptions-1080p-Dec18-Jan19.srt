14
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:29,820

Products and services in Azure
are arranged by category,

22
00:00:50,405 --> 00:00:52,775
which have various resources
that you can provision.

23

24
00:00:54,290 --> 00:00:55,955

When you provision an Azure resource,

28
00:01:03,945 --> 00:01:07,145
Azure creates one or more meter
instances for that resource.

29
00:01:07,145 --> 00:01:09,335
The meters track the resources usage,

30
00:01:09,335 --> 00:01:10,550
and each meter generates

31
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,430
a usage record that is used
to calculate your bill.

32
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:17,180
For example, a single virtual
machine that you provision in Azure,

33
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,010
might have some of
the following meters tracking

34
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,230

35
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,275
IP address hours, data transfer in,

36
00:01:24,275 --> 00:01:27,225
data transfer out, and others.

38
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:31,755

39
00:01:31,755 --> 00:01:33,050
that they can use for Azure

40
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:35,585
paid products during
a 30-day trial period.

41
00:01:35,585 --> 00:01:39,040
Once you use that $200 credit
or reach your trials end,

42
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:42,470
