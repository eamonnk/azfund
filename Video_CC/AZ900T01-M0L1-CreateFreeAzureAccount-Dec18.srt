1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,230
>> So, let's go and create
an Azure free account.

2
00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,420
We launch a browser
session with Edge,

3
00:00:06,420 --> 00:00:07,950
it's in private session to make sure

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,225
it doesn't sign in
with another account,

5
00:00:09,225 --> 00:00:10,920
we want this to be a new account.

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,540
We go to azure.microsoft.com.

7
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:20,580
This will bring us to the homepage
for Azure and you can see

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,670
there's an option here to go
to their free account section.

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,390
Or if we scroll down,

10
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:30,030
we have another option here to
sign up for a free account.

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:34,210
We click on that "Create
your free account"

12
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:41,355
and that brings us to
azure.microsoft.com free

13
00:00:41,355 --> 00:00:44,030
under create your free
account today page.

14
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,115
Before we go ahead and
create the account,

15
00:00:46,115 --> 00:00:48,440
we just scroll down to
see some more details

16
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:50,305
around the Azure free account.

17
00:00:50,305 --> 00:00:52,260
We can see the free account,

18
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,929
we got 12 months services

19
00:00:53,929 --> 00:00:55,910
$200 free credit over 30 days

20
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,890
and there are some services
which are always free.

21
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,540
If you continue to scroll down,

22
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:05,270
you'll see some more details around

23
00:01:05,270 --> 00:01:07,100
what products are free for 12 months.

24
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:10,060
There's Windows and Linux
virtual machines, disk storage,

25
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:14,120
some database services and
if we keep going down,

26
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,795
we'll see some details around
more products that are always free.

27
00:01:16,795 --> 00:01:22,865
Active Directory,
Functions, Up services.

28
00:01:22,865 --> 00:01:25,940
Then we also have a section
which provides us with

29
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:30,610
some more details and ask us
if we have to pay anything,

30
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,325
no and there's no charge
with the free account.

31
00:01:33,325 --> 00:01:36,015
You're not charged anything for it.

32
00:01:36,015 --> 00:01:37,850
What happens after you use

33
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:40,640
your $200 free credit or
your 30 days are over.

34
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,110
You can upgrade to a pay-as-you-go

35
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:44,465
subscription to get continued access.

36
00:01:44,465 --> 00:01:47,290
What happens at the end of
the 12 months free products.

37
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:48,920
Again, you can upgrade
to a pay-as-you-go

38
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,625
subscription and what
do I need to sign up?

39
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:53,360
You need a phone number, credit card,

40
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,760
debit card, and
a Microsoft account username.

41
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:59,000
If you click on the FAQ.
there's more answers in here

42
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,865
around questions for
the free account.

43
00:02:01,865 --> 00:02:03,680
You can scroll through
and have a look

44
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,700
at some of them if you need.

45
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:14,170
So we return to the free account
page and click "Start free".

46
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:21,315
We get prompted to sign in with
a Microsoft account details.

47
00:02:21,315 --> 00:02:23,510
If we don't have one,
we can create one here

48
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,930
clicking on the "Create one
link" and following the prompts,

49
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:28,370
otherwise, enter your details.

50
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:46,390
Fill in the details as
you're prompted here.

51
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:54,250
You log in a valid phone
number and connect the

52
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,580
multi-factor authentication
requiring you to enter a code or

53
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:04,120
receive and enter a code.

54
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,630
Enter your preferences as you go.

55
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,570
You need to enter your credit
or debit card number,

56
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,210
you have to check
the checkbox to agree

57
00:03:35,210 --> 00:03:38,870
to the terms and conditions
and then click "Sign up"

58
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:44,375
and that was successful
and we're ready to go.

59
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:47,560
If we click on "Go to the portal",

60
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:51,925
that brings us to the Azure portal,

61
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:55,340
with a new account and
your all new Azure subscription.

62
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,905
We get prompted
how much credit we have left.

63
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,780
We get prompted to start a tour.

64
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,050
Which we can do and follow around.

65
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:32,360
We click on "Home" and
you can click around

66
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:34,740
some services and see
we're ready to go.
