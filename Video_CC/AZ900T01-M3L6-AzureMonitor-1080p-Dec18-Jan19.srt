00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,150
>> Azure Monitor maximize
the availability and performance of

2
00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:04,620
your applications by delivering

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,360
a comprehensive solution
for collecting,

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,280
analyzing, and acting on telemetry

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,905
from your Cloud and
on-premises environments.

6
00:00:10,905 --> 00:00:12,480
It helps you understand how

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,280
your applications are
performing and proactively

8
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,315
identifies issues affecting them
on the resources they depend on.

9
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:21,450
As soon as you create an Azure
subscription and start adding

10
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:23,900
resources such as
virtual machines and web apps,

11
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:26,565
Azure Monitor starts collecting data.

12
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:30,525
Activity Logs record when
resources are created or modified,

13
00:00:30,525 --> 00:00:33,315
and Metrics tell you how
the resource is performing,

14
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:35,910
and the resources
that it's consuming.

15
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:38,520
You can extend the data
you're collecting into

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,500
the actual operation
of the resources by

17
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,915
enabling diagnostics and adding
an agent to compute resources.

18
00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:46,605
Under the Resource Settings,

19
00:00:46,605 --> 00:00:48,220
you can enable diagnostics,

20
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:51,225
and you can enable
guest-level monitoring,

21
00:00:51,225 --> 00:00:54,560
collect performance data
using performance counters,

22
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,960
enable various Event Logs,

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,350
enable or disable Crash Dumps,

24
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,310
send your diagnostic data to

25
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:03,750
other services for
more analysis using Sinks,

26
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:05,800
and configure your Agent Settings
