00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,490
>> A geography is a discrete market

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:04,530
typically containing
two or more regions,

3
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,725
that preserves data residency
and compliance boundaries.

4
00:00:07,725 --> 00:00:10,800
Geographies allow customers with
specific data residency and

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,445
compliance needs to keep
their data and applications close.

6
00:00:14,445 --> 00:00:17,670
Geographies ensured
a data residency, sovereignty,

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,085
compliance, and
resiliency requirements

8
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:22,590
are honored within
geographical boundaries.

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,510
Geographies are fault tolerant to

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:26,310
withstand complete
regional failure to

11
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,735
the connection to our dedicated,

12
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:30,390
high-capacity networking
infrastructure.

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,084
Geographies are broken
up into Americas,

14
00:00:35,084 --> 00:00:41,740
Europe, Asia Pacific,
Middle East, and Africa.
