00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,960
>> Azure Security Center is
a monitoring service that provides

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,240
threat protection across all of

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,685
your services both in
Azure and on-premises.

4
00:00:06,685 --> 00:00:08,940
Security center can provide

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:10,230
security recommendations based on

6
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:12,615
your configurations,
resources and networks.

7
00:00:12,615 --> 00:00:15,390
Monitor security settings
across on-premises and

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,340
cloud workloads and
automatically apply

9
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:20,190
required security to new
services as they come online.

10
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,850
Continuously monitor all your
services and perform

11
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,660
automatic security
assessments to identify

12
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,720
potential vulnerabilities
before they can be exploited.

13
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,630
Use Machine learning to
detect and block malware

14
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:33,615
from being installed on
your virtual machines and services.

15
00:00:33,615 --> 00:00:37,190
Analyze and identify
potential inbound attacks,

16
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:38,630
and help to investigate threats and

17
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:41,525
any post reach activity
that might have occurred.

18
00:00:41,525 --> 00:00:44,629
Provide just-in-time
access control for ports,

19
00:00:44,629 --> 00:00:46,340
reducing your attack
surface by ensuring

20
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:49,435
the network only allows
traffic that you require.

21
00:00:49,435 --> 00:00:51,740
You can integrate
security center into

22
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:54,095
your workflows and
use it in many ways.

23
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:57,620
Here are two examples; Firstly,

24
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,605
use security center for
an incident response.

25
00:01:00,605 --> 00:01:02,780
Many organizations
learn how to respond to

26
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:05,075
security incidents only
after suffering an attack.

27
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:07,370
To reduce costs and damage
it's important to have

28
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:10,985
an incident response plan in place
before an attack takes place.

29
00:01:10,985 --> 00:01:13,130
You can use Azure security center in

30
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:14,870
different stages of
an instant response.

31
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:16,940
You can use security
center during to detect,

32
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:18,950
assess, and diagnose stages.

33
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:22,775
Detect: Review the first indication
of an event investigation.

34
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:24,920
Use security center
dashboard to review

35
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,030
the initial verification that

36
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,205
a high priority security
alert was raised.

37
00:01:28,205 --> 00:01:30,875
Assess: Perform
the initial assessment

38
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:33,365
to obtain more information
about the suspicious activity.

39
00:01:33,365 --> 00:01:35,585
Obtain more information
about the security alert.

40
00:01:35,585 --> 00:01:38,329
Diagnose: Conduct
a technical investigation

41
00:01:38,329 --> 00:01:41,885
and identify containment, mitigation
and workaround strategies.

42
00:01:41,885 --> 00:01:44,060
You can follow the remediation
steps described by

43
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:46,675
security center in
that particular security alert.

44
00:01:46,675 --> 00:01:48,720
The second example, use

45
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,110
security center recommendations
to enhance security.

46
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:52,520
You can reduce the chances of

47
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,260
a significant security event
by configuring

48
00:01:54,260 --> 00:01:56,090
a security policy and
then implementing

49
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:58,490
the recommendations provided
by Azure security center.

50
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:00,830
A security policy defines
a set of controls that are

51
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,510
recommended for resources but did

52
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:05,080
not specify subscription
or resource group.

53
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,580
In security center
you define policies

54
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:10,100
according to your company's
security requirements.

55
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,750
Security center analyzes

56
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,445
the security state of
your Azure resources,

57
00:02:13,445 --> 00:02:14,810
when security center identifies

58
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:16,460
potential security vulnerabilities,

59
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,840
it creates recommendations based on

60
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,865
the control set into security policy.

61
00:02:19,865 --> 00:02:21,890
The recommendations guide
you to the process of

62
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:24,400
configuring the needed
security controls.
