1
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,630
>> So let's log into the Azure portal

2
00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:06,190
and have a look at how
we can customize it.

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,870
So we signed into the Azure Portal
by portal.azure.com.

4
00:00:10,870 --> 00:00:14,200
Their default view is
onto the homepage.

5
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:20,675
Here we have a list of useful links,

6
00:00:20,675 --> 00:00:24,135
categories, services that
you may want to use.

7
00:00:24,135 --> 00:00:26,475
You can change your default view.

8
00:00:26,475 --> 00:00:31,050
You click on settings, we
access to portal settings,

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:33,335
and we can choose our default view

10
00:00:33,335 --> 00:00:35,810
to be either the home
or the dashboard.

11
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:38,225
We can change the color contrast,

12
00:00:38,225 --> 00:00:40,955
notifications, and the language
that the UI appears,

13
00:00:40,955 --> 00:00:42,200
as well as the regional formats.

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,820
So if we select to
have the dashboard as

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,520
our default view of me login
to the portal and click Apply,

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,780
the next time you
log into the portal,

17
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:49,865
the dashboard will appear
first as the default view.

18
00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:53,360
If we click on dashboard, we
see we have a series of tiles.

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,370
We can customize and modify
our dashboard view by clicking Edit,

20
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:01,950
we can rearrange and
resize our tiles.

21
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:13,490
We can remove items,
drag them around,

22
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,110
resize them, reorder them.

23
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:19,070
We can also bring in tiles for
specific service or products

24
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,420
in the tile gallery.

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:25,460
We see for virtual machines we have

26
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:28,550
21 different tiles
available around CPU Usage,

27
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:30,895
Memory Usage, Disk Writes and more.

28
00:01:30,895 --> 00:01:32,580
We can drag these and use them.

29
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,140
If we had an application and we
wanted to keep a close eye on it,

30
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,400
we could drag into
critical resources into

31
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,520
our dashboard and have them
display in almost real-time.

32
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,530
So we can see disk writes,

33
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,430
memory, CPU performance,
and our dashboard view.

34
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,190
And when we're finished,
click Done Customizing.

35
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:48,810
You can also have
multiple dashboards,

36
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,890
you can create a new dashboard.

37
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:02,675
Drag in some tiles,

38
00:02:02,675 --> 00:02:06,530
and I can then choose
which dashboard I wish to view.

39
00:02:19,990 --> 00:02:22,970
You can download and export
the dashboard as well,

40
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:25,505
and then load it as a JSON file,

41
00:02:25,505 --> 00:02:27,725
and you can save that and share it.

42
00:02:27,725 --> 00:02:30,690
You can also access All Services,

43
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,860
if you're looking for
a particular service.

44
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,400
That's the Advisor, type
in to All Services box,

45
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,910
or virtual machines,
type in a keyword

46
00:02:43,910 --> 00:02:45,380
and you get all the related services

47
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,170
appearing which we can then chose.

48
00:02:47,170 --> 00:02:49,360
Likewise, we can click
Create a Resource,

49
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,405
type in the object that
we're looking for,

50
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:54,410
and everything related to storage in

51
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,545
this instance appears in the pane.

52
00:02:56,545 --> 00:02:59,520
Accessing the icons in the top right,

53
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:02,085
you can also provide feedback,

54
00:03:02,085 --> 00:03:06,100
obtain help, configure a settings
as we've already seen,

55
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,995
view our notifications,

56
00:03:07,995 --> 00:03:10,305
view our directory and
subscription detail,

57
00:03:10,305 --> 00:03:13,000
and also access the Cloud Shell,

58
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,290
which is a browser-based
management tool.
