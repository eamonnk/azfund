1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,920
>> Microsoft Azure is made up

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,260
of data centers located
around the globe.

3
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:06,330
These data centers are
organized and made

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:08,790
available to end users by region.

5
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:12,150
Region is a geographical area
on the planet containing

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,600
at least one or potentially
multiple data centers

7
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,490
that are in close
proximity and networked

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:19,815
together with a low-latency network.

9
00:00:19,815 --> 00:00:21,570
For most Azure services,

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:23,145
when deploying a resource in Azure,

11
00:00:23,145 --> 00:00:26,355
you choose in which region you
want to deploy your resource.

12
00:00:26,355 --> 00:00:29,595
A few examples of
regions are, West US,

13
00:00:29,595 --> 00:00:31,590
Canada Central, West Europe,

14
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:34,870
Australia East, or Japan West.

15
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:39,085
Azure has more global regions
than any of the cloud provider.

16
00:00:39,085 --> 00:00:41,765
This provides customers
the flexibility and scale

17
00:00:41,765 --> 00:00:44,720
needed to bring applications
closer to users around the world,

18
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:46,880
preserving data
residency and offering

19
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,795
comprehensive compliance and
resiliency options for customers.

20
00:00:50,795 --> 00:00:52,675
At a time of this recording,

21
00:00:52,675 --> 00:00:55,660
Azure is generally available in
42 regions around the globe,

22
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:59,135
with plans announced for
12 additional regions.

23
00:00:59,135 --> 00:01:02,270
Each Azure region is paired
with another region but in

24
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,480
the same geography such
as US, Europe, or Asia.

25
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,280
This approach allows replication of

26
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,470
resources across the geography that

27
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,390
helps reduce the likelihood
of interruptions

28
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,490
due to events such as
natural disasters,

29
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:16,200
civil unrest, or power outages.

30
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:21,795
Examples of region pairs would
be West US paired with East US,

31
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:25,225
or South-East Asia
paired with East Asia.

32
00:01:25,225 --> 00:01:28,850
Azure also has some special regions
that you might want to use

33
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,985
when building Azure applications
for compliance or legal purposes.

34
00:01:31,985 --> 00:01:34,130
We'll discuss these more
later in the course,

35
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,145
but these special regions
include US government,

36
00:01:37,145 --> 00:01:39,860
which are physical and logical
narrowed isolated instances

37
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,055
of Azure for the US government
agencies and the partners.

38
00:01:43,055 --> 00:01:46,940
Azure Germany, made available
to a data trustee model,

39
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,035
whereby customer data
remains in Germany under

40
00:01:49,035 --> 00:01:51,950
control of T-Systems at
Deutsche Telecom company,

41
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:54,185
acting as the German data trustee.

42
00:01:54,185 --> 00:01:56,090
Any user or enterprise who needs

43
00:01:56,090 --> 00:01:59,240
their data to reside in
Germany can use the service.

44
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,630
Azure China. Azure China is

45
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,860
available through
a unique partnership

46
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,930
between Microsoft and 21Vianet,

47
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,400
where Microsoft does not directly
maintain the data centers.
