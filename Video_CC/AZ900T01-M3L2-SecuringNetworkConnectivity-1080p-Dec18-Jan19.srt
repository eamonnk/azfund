1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
>> Azure Firewall is a managed

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,420
cloud-based network security service

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:05,985
that protects your Azure
virtual network resources.

4
00:00:05,985 --> 00:00:08,100
You can essentially create, enforce,

5
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,500
and log application and
network connectivity policies

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:12,900
across subscriptions
and virtual networks.

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,940
Azure Firewall includes many features

8
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:17,445
including; Built-in
high availability,

9
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:19,455
Unrestricted cloud scalability,

10
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:21,765
Inbound and Outbound filtering rules,

11
00:00:21,765 --> 00:00:23,550
and Azure Monitor logging.

12
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:25,770
Distributed denial of
service attacks attempt to

13
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,485
overwhelm on exhausted
applications resources,

14
00:00:28,485 --> 00:00:32,215
making the application slow or
unresponsive to legitimate users.

15
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:34,130
DDoS attacks can be targeted at

16
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,190
any endpoint that is publicly
reachable through the internet.

17
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,250
DDoS results exposed to
the internet such as a website,

18
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,340
is at risk of being attacked
by a denial of service attack.

19
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,070
When you combine
Azure DDoS Protection

20
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:48,050
with application design
best practices,

21
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,795
you help provide defense
against DDoS attacks.

22
00:00:50,795 --> 00:00:53,660
DDoS Protection leverages
the scale and elasticity of

23
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:55,370
Microsoft's global network to bring

24
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:58,835
DDoS mitigation capacity
to every Azure region.

25
00:00:58,835 --> 00:01:01,970
Network Security Groups allow
you to filter network traffic

26
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,805
to and from Azure resources
in an Azure virtual network.

27
00:01:04,805 --> 00:01:09,070
An NSG can contain multiple inbound
and outbound security rules,

28
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:11,900
that enabled it to filter
traffic to and from resources by

29
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,835
source and destination IP
Address, port, and protocol.

30
00:01:15,835 --> 00:01:17,920
When you create a Nertwork
Security Group,

31
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,100
Azure creates a series of

32
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:21,965
default rules to provide
a baseline level of security.

33
00:01:21,965 --> 00:01:24,005
You cannot remove the default rules,

34
00:01:24,005 --> 00:01:25,220
which you can't override them,

35
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,500
by creating new rules
but higher priorities.

36
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,969
When choosing an Azure
network security solution,

37
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:34,790
it's not enough to simply focus
on security within perimeter,

38
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:38,575
or our network security between
services inside a network.

39
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:41,690
A layered approach provides
multiple levels of protection,

40
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:43,760
so that if an attacker
gets through one layer,

41
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:45,545
there are fraud protections in place.

42
00:01:45,545 --> 00:01:47,510
A common security concept
that is applied

43
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:49,730
to computing systems
is Defense in Depth,

44
00:01:49,730 --> 00:01:53,215
which is essentially a layered
approach to providing security.

45
00:01:53,215 --> 00:01:56,240
Perimeter Layer. The Network
Perimeter Layers about

46
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,650
protecting organizations from

47
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:59,840
network-based attacks
against your resources.

48
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,970
Identifying these
attacks, alerting and

49
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:04,760
eliminating their impact is important
to keep your network secure.

50
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:08,000
To do this, you can use Azure
DDoS Protection to filter

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,620
large-scale attacks
before they can cause

52
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:12,215
denial of service for end-users.

53
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,020
Use perimeter firewalls
with Azure Firewall to

54
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,605
identify and alert on a malicious
attacks against your network.

55
00:02:18,605 --> 00:02:22,370
The Networking Layer, at
this layer to focuses on limiting

56
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:24,470
network connectivity
across all your resources

57
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,240
to only allow what is required.

58
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,030
As best practices, you should,

59
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:30,050
limit communication
between resources through

60
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:33,340
segmenting your network and
configuring access controls.

61
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,870
Deny be Default, restrict

62
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:39,455
inbound internet access
intimate outbound where appropriate.

63
00:02:39,455 --> 00:02:43,460
Implement secure connectivity
to on-premises networks.

64
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,190
Combining services.
You can also combine

65
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:48,150
multiple Azure networking and
security services to manage

66
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,560
your network security and provide
increased layered protection.

67
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,495
You can combine Network Security
Groups and Azure Firewall.

68
00:02:55,495 --> 00:02:58,720
Azure Firewall compliments Network
Security Group functionality,

69
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,350
together they provide better defense

70
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:02,375
in depth and network security.

71
00:03:02,375 --> 00:03:05,015
You can combine Application Gateway

72
00:03:05,015 --> 00:03:07,630
WebApplication Firewall
and Azure Firewall.

73
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,700
Web Application Firewall is
a feature of application gateway,

74
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,560
that provides centralized
inbound protection

75
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,714
of your web applications,

76
00:03:13,714 --> 00:03:16,805
from common exploits
and vulnerabilities.

77
00:03:16,805 --> 00:03:19,190
As computing environments move from

78
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:21,695
customer controlled data centers
to cloud datacenters,

79
00:03:21,695 --> 00:03:24,005
the responsibility for
security also shifts.

80
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:26,090
Security is now a concern shared by

81
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,100
both the cloud provider
and the customers.
