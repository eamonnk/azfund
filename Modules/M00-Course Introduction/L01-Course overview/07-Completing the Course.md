# Completing the Course #

If you are new to the edX learning platform, here is some information to help you get started. Even if you have used edX for other courses, the information provided here will help orient you to how this course is laid out.

### Layout of the course ###
This course is laid out in modules, lessons, and units. Each module contains one or more lessons that subdivide the material for that module. The lessons contain units, which include the learning materials for that particular subject area. To navigate through the module's units, use the navigation bar at the top of the module. You can use the left and right arrows to move through each unit.

Each module will generally have **video content**, **reading material**, and **problem sets**, and a set of **module review questions** to test your knowledge. Some units also have a **discussion board** where you can post questions and other material so that fellow students can provide feedback. The units are meant to be taken in order, but you can skip around if you already have mastered the material in a particular unit. To do well on the assessments, you should learn the material in all the units. **Hover over the unit with your mouse to see the unit title.**

However, we encourage you to seek help and feedback from your fellow students by using the discussion boards. This is a great way to help each other out, network, and enrich your learning experience.
