<h1><strong><span style="color: #0000CD;">Service Trust Portal</span></strong></h1>


The *Service Trust Portal* (STP) hosts the Compliance Manager service, and is the Microsoft public site for publishing audit reports and other compliance-related information relevant to Microsoftâ€™s cloud services. STP users can download audit reports produced by external auditors and gain insight from Microsoft-authored reports that provide details on how Microsoft builds and operates its cloud services.

STP also includes information about how Microsoft online services can help your organization maintain and track compliance with standards, laws, and regulations, such as:

- ISO
- SOC
- NIST
- FedRAMP
- GDPR

STP is a companion feature to the Trust Center, and allows you to:

- Access audit reports across Microsoft cloud services on a single page.
- Access compliance guides to help you understand how can you use Microsoft cloud service features to manage compliance with various regulations.
- Access trust documents to help you understand how Microsoft cloud services help protect your data.
