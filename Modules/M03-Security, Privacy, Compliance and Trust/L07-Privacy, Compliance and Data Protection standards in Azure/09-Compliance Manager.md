*Compliance Manager* is a workflow-based risk assessment dashboard within the Trust Portal that enables you to track, assign, and verify your organization's regulatory compliance activities related to Microsoft professional services and Microsoft cloud services such as Office 365, Dynamics 365, and Azure.


Compliance Manager provides the following features:

- Combines the following three items:
	1. Detailed information provided by Microsoft to auditors and regulators, as part of various third-party audits of Microsoft 's cloud services against various standards (for example, ISO 27001, ISO 27018, and NIST).
	2. Information that Microsoft compiles internally for its compliance with regulations (such as HIPAA and the EU GDPR).
	3. An organization's self-assessment of their own compliance with these standards and regulations.
- Enables you to assign, track, and record compliance and assessment-related activities, which can help your organization cross team barriers to achieve your organization's compliance goals.
- Provides a Compliance Score to help you track your progress and prioritize auditing controls that will help reduce your organization's exposure to risk.
- Provides a secure repository in which to upload and manage evidence and other artifacts related to compliance activities.
- Produces richly detailed reports in Microsoft Excel that document the compliance activities performed by Microsoft and your organization, which can be provided to auditors, regulators, and other compliance stakeholders.
