Microsoft Azure Germany is built on the Microsoft trusted cloud principles of security, privacy, compliance, and transparency. It brings data residency in transit and at rest in Germany, and data replication across German datacenters for business continuity.

Customer data in the two datacenters is managed under the control of a data trustee, T-Systems International. This trustee is an independent German company and a subsidiary of Deutsche Telekom. It provides additional controls for customers’ data, because access is provided only with the permission of customers or the data trustee. Microsoft commercial cloud services in these new datacenters adhere to German data-handling regulations, and give customers additional choices for how and where data is processed.

Anyone who requires data to reside in Germany can use this service.

Azure Germany includes the core components of IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. These components include infrastructure, network, storage, data management, identity management, and many other services.

Azure Germany supports most of the same great features that global Azure customers use, such as geosynchronous data replication and autoscaling. 


Most technical content that's currently available assumes that applications are being developed for global Azure, rather than for Azure Germany. It’s important to ensure that developers are aware of key differences for applications being developed for hosting in Azure Germany:

- Certain services and features that are in specific regions of global Azure might not be available in Azure Germany.
- Features that are offered in Azure Germany have configuration differences from global Azure. You should review your sample code, configurations, and steps to ensure that you are building and executing within the Azure Germany environment.
