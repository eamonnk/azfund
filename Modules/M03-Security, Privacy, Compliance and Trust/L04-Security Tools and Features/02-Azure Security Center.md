<h1><strong><span style="color: #0000CD;">Azure Security Center</span></strong></h1>



*Azure Security Center* is a monitoring service that provides threat protection across all of your services both in Azure, and on-premises. Security Center can:

- Provide security recommendations based on your configurations, resources, and networks.
- Monitor security settings across on-premises and cloud workloads, and automatically apply required security to new services as they come online.
- Continuously monitor all your services, and perform automatic security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
- Use machine learning to detect and block malware from being installed on your virtual machines and services. You can also define a list of allowed applications to ensure that only the apps you validate are allowed to execute.
- Analyze and identify potential inbound attacks, and help to investigate threats and any post-breach activity that might have occurred.
- Provide just-in-time access control for ports, reducing your attack surface by ensuring the network only allows traffic that you require.
