Below is an outline of some of the advantages and disadvantages for public, private, and hybrid clouds.

### Public cloud

- **Advantages**:
    - **No CapEx**. You donâ€™t have to buy a new server in order to scale.
    - **Agility**. Applications can be made accessible quickly, and deprovisioned whenever needed.
    - **Consumption-based model**. Organizations pay only for what they use, and operate under an OpEx model.
    - **Maintenance**. Organizations have no responsibility for hardware maintenance or updates.
    - **Skills**. No deep technical skills are required to deploy, use, and gain the benefits of a public cloud. Organizations can leverage the skills and expertise of the cloud provider to ensure workloads are secure, safe, and highly available.

- **Disadvantages**:
    - **Security**. There may be specific security requirements that cannot be met by using public cloud.
    - **Compliance**. There may be government policies, industry standards, or legal requirements which public clouds cannot meet.
    - **Ownership**. Organizations don't own the hardware or services and cannot manage them as they may wish. 
    - **Specific scenarios**. If organizations have a unique business requirement, such as having to maintain a legacy application, it may be hard to meet that requirement with public cloud services.




### Private cloud


- **Advantages**:
    - **Control**. Organizations have complete control over the resources.
    - **Security**. Organizations have complete control over security.
    - **Compliance**. If organizations have very strict security, compliance, or legal requirements, a private cloud may be the only viable option.
    - **Specific scenarios**. If an organization has a specific scenario not easily supported by a public cloud provider (such as having to maintain a legacy application), it may be preferable to run the application locally.

- **Disadvantages**:
    - **Upfront CapEx**. Hardware must be purchased for start-up and maintenance.
    - **Agility**. Private clouds are not as agile as public clouds, because you need to purchase and set up all the underlying infrastructure before they can be leveraged.
    - **Maintenance**. Organizations have the responsibility for hardware maintenance and updates.
    - **Skills**. Private clouds requires in-house IT skills and expertise that may be hard to get or be costly.



### Hybrid cloud


- **Advantages**:
    - **Flexibility**. The most flexible scenario; with a hybrid cloud setup, an organization can decide to run their applications either in a private cloud or in a public cloud.  
    - **Costs**. Organizations can take advantage of economies of scale from public cloud providers for services and resources as they wish. This allows them to access cheaper storage than they can provide themselves.
    - **Control**. Organizations can still access resources over which they have total control.
    - **Security**. Organizations can still access resources for which they are responsible for security.
    - **Compliance**. Organizations maintain the ability to comply with strict security, compliance, or legal requirements as needed.
    - **Specific scenarios**. Organizations maintain the ability to support specific scenarios not easily supported by a public cloud provider, such as running legacy applications. In this case, they can keep the old system running locally, and connect it to the public cloud for authorization or storage. Additionally, they could host a website in the public cloud, and link it to a highly secure database hosted in their private cloud.


- **Disadvantages**:
    - **Upfront CapEx**. Upfront CapEx is still required before organizations can leverage a private cloud.
    - **Costs**. Purchasing and maintaining a private cloud to use alongside the public cloud can be more expensive than selecting a single deployment model.  
    - **Skills**. Deep technical skills are still required to be able to set up a private cloud.
    - **Ease of management**. Organizations need to ensure there are clear guidelines to avoid confusion, complications or misuse.
