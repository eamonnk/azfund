<h1><strong><span style="color: #0000CD;">Hybrid cloud</span></strong></h1>

A hybrid cloud combines both public and private clouds, allowing you to run your applications in the most appropriate location.

Hybrid cloud models have the following characteristics:

- **Resource location**. Specific resources run or are used in a public cloud, and others run or are used in a private cloud.
- **Cost and efficiency**. Hybrid cloud models allow an organization to leverage some of the benefits of cost, efficiency, and scale that are available with a public cloud model.
- **Control**. Organizations retain management control in private clouds.
- **Skills**. Technical skills are still required to maintain the private cloud and ensure both cloud models can operate together.

An example of a hybrid cloud usage scenario would be hosting a website in the public cloud and linking it to a highly secure database hosted in a private cloud.

Hybrid cloud scenarios can be useful when organizations have some things that cannot be put in a public cloud, possibly for legal reasons. For example, you may have medical data that cannot be exposed publicly.

Another example is one or more applications that run on old hardware that canâ€™t be updated. In this case, you can keep the old system running locally in your private cloud, and connect it to the public cloud for authorization or storage.
