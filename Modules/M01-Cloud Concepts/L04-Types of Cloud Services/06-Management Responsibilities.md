The following list of cloud service types describes the management responsibilities for the user and the cloud provider as compared to on-premises systems:

- IaaS requires the most user management of all the cloud services. The user is responsible for managing the operating systems, data, and applications.
- PaaS requires less user management. The cloud provider manages the operating systems, and the user is responsible for the applications and data they run and store.
- SaaS requires the least amount  of management. The cloud provider is responsible for managing everything, and the end user just uses the software.

> **Note**: It is important that users understand what they are responsible for, when using cloud services, to ensure their workloads are managed correctly and don't suffer any down time. There is a **shared responsibility model** for ensuring cloud workloads are run securely and in a well-managed way. Depending on the service you are using: the cloud provider is responsible for some aspects of the workload management, and the end user is responsible for other aspects of the workload management.
