<h1><strong><span style="color: #0000CD;">Consumption-based model</span></strong></h1> 

Cloud service providers operate on a *consumption-based model*, which means that end users only pay for the resources that they use. Whatever they use is what they pay for.

This consumption-based model brings with it many benefits, including:

- No upfront costs
- No need to purchase and manage costly infrastructure that they may or may not use to its fullest
- The ability to pay for additional resources if and when they are needed
- The ability to stop paying for resources that are no longer needed
