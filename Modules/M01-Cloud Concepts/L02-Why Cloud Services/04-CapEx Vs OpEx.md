In previous years, startup companies needed to acquire a physical premises and infrastructure to start their business and begin trading. Large amounts of money were need to get a new business up and running, or to grow an existing company. They would have to buy new datacenters or new servers to allow them build out new services, which they could then deliver to their customers. That is no longer the case. 

Today, organizations can sign up for a service from a cloud provider to get up and running. This enables them to begin selling or providing services to their customers more quickly, without the need for significant upfront costs.

These two approaches to investment are referred to as:

- **Capital Expenditure (CapEx)**: This is the spending of money on physical infrastructure up front, and then deducting that expense from your tax bill over time. CapEx is an upfront cost which has a value that reduces over time.

- **Operational Expenditure (OpEx)**: This is spending money on services or products now and being billed for them now. You can deduct this expense from your tax bill in the same year. There is no upfront cost, you pay for a service or product as you use it.

Companies wanting to start a new business or grow their business do not have to incur upfront costs to try out a new product or service for customers. Instead, they can get into a market immediately and pay as much or as little for the infrastructure as the business requires. They also can terminate that cost if and when they need to.

If your service is busy and you consume a lot of resources in a month, then you receive a large bill. If those services are minimal and don't use a lot of resources, then you will receive a smaller bill.

A business can still use the CapEx expenditure strategy if they wish, but it is no longer a requirement that they do so.
