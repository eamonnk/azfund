## 1. Multiple Choice

Your goal is to predict emergency room wait times, based on information such as the day of the week, the staffing information at the hospital, the symptoms of the patient, and other factors.   

You have 2 years of past data from the hospital.  

>>What type of machine learning technique would you use for this? (Choose one)<<  

( ) Recommender systems  
( ) Clustering  
(x) Regression  
( ) Classification  

[explanation]  
Attempting to predict a numeric value based on past data is an example of regression.  
[explanation]  


## 2. Checkbox  

You create an Azure Machine Learning experiment and add a dataset.   

You need to add a module that runs a custom script to manipulate the data in the dataset.   

>>Which three of the following scripting languages can you use? (Choose all that apply)<<    

[x] Python  
[ ] Visual Basic  
[x] R   
[x] SQL    
[ ] C#  

[explanation]   
Azure ML includes modules for R, Python, and SQL scripts   
[explanation]   

## 3. Dropdown  

You have 2 years of past data from a hospital, including fields such as the day of the week, staffing level, the symptoms of the patient, and wait time.  

You must use this data to create a machine learning model that can predict emergency room wait times based on the other information.  

>>Which of the following terms is used to describe the field containing the wait time? (Choose one)<<   

[[  
Feature   
Class   
Vector   
(Label)   
]]  

[explanation]  
The value you are training a model to predict is called a Label.  
[explanation]  


## 4. Numerical input or Text input  

You are examining the following code  
<pre><code>  
x &lt;- 5 + 6    
y &lt;- x + 3   
z &lt;- y - 10   
z  
</code></pre>  

>>What will be printed in the console when you run the code?<<  

= 4   

[explanation]    
x equals 11, y equals 14, z equals 4   
[explanation]
