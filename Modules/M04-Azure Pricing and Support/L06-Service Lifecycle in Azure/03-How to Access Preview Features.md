### Portal preview features

You can access preview features that are specific to the Azure Portal from the <a href="https://preview.portal.azure.com" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">Portal Preview Features</span></a> page. Typical portal preview features provide performance, navigation, and accessibility improvements to the Azure portal interface.

Azure customers can provide feedback on the portal preview features they've tested by *sending a smile* in the portal or by posting ideas and suggestions on the *Azure Portal Feedback Forum*. You can revert to the default Azure portal by going to the <a href="https://portal.azure.com" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">Standard Portal</span></a> page.
