<h1><strong><span style="color: #0000CD;">General Availability (GA)</span></strong></h1>


Once a feature is evaluated and tested successfully, it may be released to customers as part of Azure's default product, service or feature set.

In other words, the feature may be made available for all Azure customers, and a feature released to all Azure customers typically goes to *General Availability* or *GA*.

The above image outlines the general progress and process for features and bugs during product and feature development lifecycle.

> **Note**: It's common for features to move from Azure preview features to GA, based on customer evaluation and feedback.
