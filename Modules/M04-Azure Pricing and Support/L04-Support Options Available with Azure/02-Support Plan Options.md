### Support-plan availability and billing

The support plans you can select and how you are billed for support depends on the type of Azure customer you are, and on the type of Azure subscription you have.

For example, Developer support is not available to Enterprise customers. Enterprise customers can purchase Standard, Professional Direct, and Premier support plans, and be billed for support as part of an Enterprise Agreement (EA). Alternatively, if you purchase a support plan within a pay-as-you-go subscription, your support plan is charged to your monthly Azure subscription bill.
