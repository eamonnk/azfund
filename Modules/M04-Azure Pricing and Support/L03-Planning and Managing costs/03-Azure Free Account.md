<h1><strong><span style="color: #0000CD;">Azure free account</span></strong></h1>

An Azure free account provides subscribers with a $200 Azure credit that they can use for paid Azure products during a 30-day trial period. Once you use that $200 credit or reach your trial's end, Azure suspends your account unless you sign up for a paid account.

If you upgrade to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription within the 30-day trial period, by providing your credit or debit card details, you can use a limited selection of free services for 12 months. After 12 months, you will be billed for the services and products in use on your account at the pay-as-you-go rate.
