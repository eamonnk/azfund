<h1><strong><span style="color: #0000CD;">Purchasing Azure products and services</span></strong></h1>

There are three main customer types on which the available purchasing options for Azure products and services is contingent, including:

- *Enterprise*. Enterprise customers sign an Enterprise Agreement with Azure that commits them to spending a negotiated amount on Azure services, which they typically pay annually. Enterprise customers also have access to customized Azure pricing.

- *Web direct*. Web Direct customers sign up for Azure through <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">the Azure website</span></a>.  Web direct customers pay general public prices for Azure resources, and their monthly billing and payments occur through the Azure website.

- *Cloud Solution Provider*. Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) typically are Microsoft partner companies that a customer hires to build solutions on top of Azure. Payment and billing for Azure usage occurs through the customer's CSP.

Products and services in Azure are arranged by category, which have various resources that you can provision. You select the Azure products and services that fit your requirements, and your account is billed according to Azure's pay-for-what-you-use model.

### Usage meters

When you provision an Azure resource, Azure creates one or more meter instances for that resource. The meters track the resources' usage, and each meter generates a usage record that is used to calculate your bill.

For example, a single virtual machine that you provision in Azure might have the following meters tracking its usage:


- Compute Hours
- IP Address Hours
- Data Transfer In
- Data Transfer Out
- Standard Managed Disk
- Standard Managed Disk Operations
- Standard IO-Disk
- Standard IO-Block Blob Read
- Standard IO-Block Blob Write
- Standard IO-Block Blob Delete
