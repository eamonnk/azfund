Using Azure requires an Azure subscription, which provides you with authenticated and authorized access to Azure products and services, and allows you to provision resources. An Azure subscription is a logical unit of Azure services that links to an Azure account, which is an identity in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) or in a directory that an Azure AD trusts.

Azure offers free and paid subscription options to suit different needs and requirements. An account can have one subscription or multiple subscriptions that have different billing models and to which you apply different access-management policies.
