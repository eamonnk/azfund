In this module you've learned about core Microsoft Azure architectural components, core Azure services and solutions, and various management tools that are available to manage and configure Azure.


### Core Azure architectural components
In this lesson we learned about how Azure datacenters and services are located and organized in regions and geographies. We also learned how availability is achieved using availability zones and availability sets. We gained an understanding of how to automate deployments and configuration of resources and services using declarative JSON templates that utilize the Azure Resource Manager layer to create and configure resources. And finally, we learned how to use resource groups for managing resources in Azure.

### Core Azure services and products
In this lesson we learned about compute services, and the use of virtual machines and containers. We gained an understanding of some of the services that make up the compute service such as Azure VMs, VM scale sets, app services and functions, Azure Container Instances, and Azure Kubernetes Service. We also learned about networking services such as Virtual Network, Azure Load Balancer, VPN Gateway, Application Gateway, and Azure Content Delivery Network.

### Azure solutions
In this lesson we learned about solutions such as IoT, and services that form part of the service offering such as Azure IoT Hub and Microsoft IoT Central. We discussed big data analytics services such as Azure SQL Data Warehouse, HDInsight, and Azure Data Lake Analytics. We also learned about AI and how it utilizes machine learning services such as Azure Machine Learning and Azure Machine Learning Studio. We also learned about serverless computing services such as Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, and Azure Event Grid. Finally we learned about DevOps services such as Azure DevOps and Azure DevTest Labs.

### Azure management tools
In this lesson we learned about the management tools available for managing and configuring Azure, such as Azure Portal, Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, and Azure Cloud Shell. It also includes Azure Advisor, which provides recommendations on high availability, security, performance, and cost.
