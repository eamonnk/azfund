<h1><strong><span style="color: #0000CD;">Azure database services</span></strong></h1>


Azure database services are fully-managed PaaS database services that free up valuable time youâ€™d otherwise spend managing your database. Enterprise-grade performance with built-in high availability means you can scale quickly and reach global distribution without worrying about costly downtime. Developers can take advantage of industry-leading innovations such as built-in security with automatic monitoring and threat detection, automatic tuning for improved performance, and turnkey global distribution. 

Some of the most common data service types in Azure as follows:


### **Azure Cosmos DB**

*Microsoft Azure Cosmos DB* is a globally distributed database service that enables you to elastically and independently scale throughput and storage across any number of Azure's geographic regions. It supports schema-less data that lets you build highly responsive and Always On applications to support constantly changing data. You can use Cosmos DB to store data that is updated and maintained by users around the world. It makes it easy to build scalable, highly responsive applications at global scale.

Azure SQL Database is a relational database as a service (DaaS) based on the latest stable version of Microsoft SQL Server database engine. SQL Database is a high-performance, reliable, fully managed and secure database that you can use to build data-driven applications and websites in the programming language of your choice without needing to manage infrastructure.

The Azure Database Migration Service is a fully-managed service designed to enable seamless migrations from multiple database sources to Azure data platforms with minimal downtime (online migrations). The service uses the Microsoft Data Migration Assistant to generate assessment reports that provide recommendations to help guide you through required changes prior to performing a migration. Once you assess and perform any remediation required, you're ready to begin the migration process. The Azure Database Migration Service performs all of the required steps.
