<h1><strong><span style="color: #0000CD;">Geographies</span></strong></h1>

A *geography* is a discrete market typically containing two or more regions that preserves data residency and compliance boundaries.

Geographies allow customers with specific data-residency and compliance needs to keep their data and applications close. Geographies ensure that data residency, sovereignty, compliance, and resiliency requirements are honored within geographical boundaries. Geographies are fault-tolerant to withstand complete region failure through their connection to dedicated high-capacity networking infrastructure.

Geographies are broken up into *Americas*, *Europe*, *Asia Pacific*, *Middle East and Africa*.
