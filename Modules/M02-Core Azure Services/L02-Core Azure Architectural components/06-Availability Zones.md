*Availability zones* are physically separate locations within an Azure region. Each availability zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. It is set up to be an isolation boundary. If one availability zone goes down, the other continues working. The availability zones are typically connected to each other through very fast, private fiber-optic networks.

Availability zones allow customers to run mission-critical applications with high availability and low-latency replication.

Availability zones are offered as a service within Azure, and to ensure resiliency, thereâ€™s a minimum of three separate zones in all enabled regions.

Regions that support Availability Zones include *Central US*, *North Europe*, *SouthEast Asia*, and more.
