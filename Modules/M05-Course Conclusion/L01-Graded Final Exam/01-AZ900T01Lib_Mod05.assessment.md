>>The ability to keep services up and running for long periods of time, with very little downtime, refers to which characteristics?<<


(x) High availability
( ) Disaster recovery
( ) Elasticity
( ) Global reach

[explanation]
High availability is the ability to keep services up and running for long periods of time, with very little downtime, is correct.

Disaster recovery is the ability to recover from an event which has taken down a cloud service. Cloud services disaster recovery can happen very quickly with automation and services being readily available to use.
Elasticity is the ability to automatically increase or decrease resources as needed. Elastic resources match the current needs, and resources are added or removed automatically to meet future needs when it’s needed, and from the most advantageous geographic location. A distinction between scalability and elasticity is that elasticity is done automatically.
Global reach is the ability reach audiences around the globe. Cloud services can have presence in various regions across the globe which you can access, giving you a presence in those regions even though you may not have any infrastructure in that region.

>>A cloud provider’s ability to react quickly to changes in the cloud services they offer called what?<<


( ) Customer latency capabilities
(x) Agility
( ) Scalability
( ) Fault tolerance

[explanation]
Agility is correct. It is the ability to react quickly. Cloud services can allocate and deallocate resources quickly. They are provided on-demand via self-service, so vast amounts of computing resources can be provisioned in minutes. There is no manual intervention in provisioning or deprovisioning services.

Customer latency capabilities are if customers are experiencing slowness with a particular cloud service, they are said to be experiencing some latency. Even though modern fiber optics are  fast, it can still take time for services to react to customer actions if the service is not local to the customer. Cloud services have the ability deploy resources in datacenters around the globe, thus addressing customer latency issues.

Scalability is the ability to increase or decrease resources for any given workload. You can add additional resources to service a workload (known as scaling out), or add additional capabilities to manage an increase in demand to the existing resource (known as scaling up). Scalability doesn't have to be done automatically.

Fault tolerance is the ability to remain up and running even in the event of a component or service no longer functioning. Typically, redundancy is built into cloud services architecture so if one component fails, a backup component takes its place. The type of service is said to be tolerant of faults.

With serverless computing, scaling and performance are handled manually
Serverless computing runs your code but requires management of the infrastructure
(With Serverless computing, serverless apps run only when triggered by an event)
You need to reserve resources before you can use Serverless computing
]]


[explanation]
Serverless apps run only when triggered by an event is the correct answer. All other answers are incorrect.

Serverless computing is a cloud-hosted execution environment that runs your code but abstracts the underlying hosting environment. You create an instance of the service and you add your code. No infrastructure configuration or maintenance is required, or even allowed. 

You configure your serverless apps to respond to events. An event could be a REST endpoint, a periodic timer, or even a message received from another Azure service. The serverless app runs only when it's triggered by an event.

Scaling and performance are handled automatically, and you are billed only for the exact resources you use. You don't even need to reserve resources.

[explanation]
When you provision an Azure resource, Azure creates one or more meter instances is correct.

Usage meters are used to determine Azure costs for each billing period.  When you provision an Azure resource, Azure creates one or more meter instances for that resource.  The meters track the resources&apos;s usage.  Each meter generates a usage record, which is then used to calculate your bill.  The usage tracked by a meter is corelated with a quantity of billable units, which are charged to your account for each billing period.

>>Complete the following sentence.  Performance targets for Azure products and services are defined within...?<<

(choose one)

( ) Professional Direct support plans
(x) Service Level Agreements (SLAs)
( ) Virtual Machines
( ) Quotas

[explanation]
Performance targets for Azure products and services are defined within Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

Performance targets defined within a SLA are specific to each Azure product and service.  A typical SLA sets out performance target commitments that range from 99.9% (three nines) to 99.99% (four nines), for each corresponding Azure product or service.  Azure SLAs also describe how Microsoft responds when a product or service fails to perform to its governing SLA&apos;s specification.

>>True or false: As you increase availability, you decrease the complexity of your solution?<<

( ) True
(X) False

[explanation]
False: As you increase availability, you INCREASE the complexity of your solution.

Availability refers to the proportion of time that a system is functional and working.  Maximizing availability requires implementing measures to prevent possible service failures.  Devising preventative measures can be difficult and expensive, and often results in complex solutions.  As you increase availability, you also increase the cost and complexity of your solution

Most providers prefer to maximize the availability of their Azure solutions, by minimizing downtime.  But, it is important to carefully consider the time window that your Application SLA performance targets are measured against.  The smaller the time window, the tighter the tolerances.  If you define your Application SLA in terms of hourly or daily uptime (i.e. Availability), you may not always set achievable SLA performance targets.

>>Complete the following sentence.  General Availability (GA) features are available as..?<<

[[
Azure Public Preview Features only.
Azure Private Preview Features only.
Azure Portal Preview Features only.
(part of Azure's default product, service or feature set.)
]]

[explanation]
General Availability (GA) features are available as part of Azure&apos;s default product, service or feature set.

Once a feature has been evaluated and tested successfully, it may be released to customers as part of Azure&apos;s default product, service or feature set.  A feature released to all Azure customers in this way, is said to have General Availability (GA).  In the lifecycle of a typical Azure feature, it is common for a feature to move from Azure preview to general availability (based on customer evaluation and feedback).
